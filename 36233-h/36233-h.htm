<h3>FOREWORD</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book, like most books, consists both of
facts and opinions. In order to fortify the facts,
and so that it may be clearly seen that the
opinions are justified, a number of extracts from
the &#8220;Report on the Treatment of British
Prisoners of War in Turkey,&#8221; which was presented
to Parliament in November, 1918, are
included here by the special permission of the
Controller of His Majesty&#8217;s Stationery Office.
So few people read Government publications that
this course seems necessary.</p>

<p>In this official report it is stated that out of
16,583 British and Indian prisoners &#8220;Believed
Captured,&#8221; 3,290 are dead, and 2,222 untraced
and almost certainly dead. But this report was
compiled before the end of the war and is admittedly
incomplete. I do not know the actual statistics,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
which must by now be available, nor do I
know where to obtain them. But, as stated in the
book, we in Turkey believed that about 75 per
cent. of the British rank and file perished within
two years of being captured. It may be that we
were unduly pessimistic; it is very sincerely to be
hoped that we were, and on the whole it seems
probable. But I leave the figure unaltered in the
text, for it was our sincere belief after very
difficult and laborious enquiries made secretly.
In the official report the figures show that of a
total of 4,932 British believed captured, no less
than 2,289 are either dead or untraced. This
amounts to 46 per cent. It would be interesting
to know the final figures.</p>

<p>The extracts taken from the report have been
selected because they are either general in
character or have special reference to Angora or
Afion Kara Hissar, the two camps I knew personally.</p>

<p>I am indebted to three fellow-prisoners for the
photograph reproduced as a frontispiece to this
book, for the piece of music, for reading the MS.,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
and for reading the proofs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Extracts from a Report on the Treatment
of British Prisoners of War in Turkey.</span></h3>

<p>The history of the British prisoners of war in
Turkey has faithfully reflected the peculiarities
of the Turkish character. Some of these, at any
rate to the distant spectator, are sufficiently
picturesque; others are due to the mere dead-weight
of Asiatic indifference and inertia; others
again are actively and resolutely barbarous. It
has thus happened that at the same moment there
have been prisoners treated with almost theatrical
politeness and consideration, prisoners left to
starve and die through simple neglect and incompetence,
and prisoners driven and tormented like
beasts. These violent inconsistencies make it
very difficult to give a coherent and general
account of the experience of our men. Almost
any unqualified statement can be contradicted
again and again by undoubted facts; and the
whole subject seems often to be ruled by nothing
but pure chance.</p>

<p class="tb">Yet on the whole there are two principles
which may be detected as influencing the behaviour
of the Turk in this matter, first and last,
one being an affair of deliberate policy, the other
instinctive and customary. Mixed in with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
good deal of easy-going kindness, there is always
to be found the conviction that it can matter
little what becomes of the ordinary mass, so long
as compliments are paid to the great. It has
doubtless been a real surprise to the Turkish mind,
even in high places, to learn that the rights of the
common soldier are seriously regarded by western
opinion&mdash;the rights, moreover, of a few thousand
disarmed men who could be no longer used in
battle. This principle has not always been
effective, it must be added, in its application to
prisoners of higher rank, as some of the following
pages will abundantly show; but it has seldom
failed in the treatment of the rank and file.
These have had small reason in their helplessness
to regard the Turk as that chivalrous and
honourable foe of whom we have sometimes
heard.</p>

<p class="tb">It need scarcely be said that the level of
surgical and medical skill is low in Turkey.
There are good doctors, but not many of them,
and it is only in Constantinople that they are to
be found. In the provincial towns the hospitals
are nearly always places of neglect and squalor,
where a sick man is simply left to take his chance
of recovery, a chance greatly compromised by
Turkey&#8217;s total indifference to the first rudiments
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
of sanitation. Such hospitals are naturally the
last to be provided with adequate stock or equipment
of any kind; and even if some modern
appliance is by fortune forthcoming, it will probably
be beyond the local talent to make use of it.
In a very horrible Red Crescent hospital at
Angora, for example, there was at one time seen
an excellent German disinfecting apparatus
standing idle amidst the filth, because no one
could tell how it was worked. It is fair to say that
in such places there is no distinction between the
treatment of prisoners and that of Turkish sick
or wounded; all suffer alike by reason of a state
of civilisation centuries out of date.</p>

<p class="tb">It was characteristic, too, that until the end
of 1916, or even later, the only clearing-station
that existed in the city, where the men discharged
from hospital were collected until they could be
sent into the interior, was apparently the
common civil prison, a most vile and filthy place,
in which many of our men lay for weeks until
the convenient moment happened to come for
removing them. At first they were lodged
there in ordinary cells; later they would occupy
the gallery of a large hall, where their tedium was
relieved by witnessing the vociferous floggings of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
the criminals on the floor below. This would
seem to be the same prison as that in which
certain British naval officers have at different
times undergone most barbarous punishment (in
the name of &#8220;reprisals&#8221;), by being confined for
many weeks underground, without sight of day,
in solitude and severe privation. As a collecting
place for prisoners from hospital it was superseded
in 1917 by a camp at Psamatia, a suburb of the
city, installed in a disused Armenian school and
church. This was at first a dirty and disagreeable
place; though supposed to be in some measure
for convalescents, it was always a struggle to get
so much as a wash there; but under a better commandant
it was improved later on.</p>

<p class="tb">But before going further we may give what is
in effect the substance of our whole report&mdash;the
epitome, in unmistakable terms, of the story
of the prisoners&#8217; treatment. The officially
announced figures of the mortality among them,
so far as are known up to the present date, give
the exact measure of the meaning of captivity in
Turkey. The total number of officers and men
believed to have been taken prisoners by the
Turks from the beginning of the war is 16,583.
Of these 3,290 have been reported dead, while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
2,222 remain untraced, and we must believe that
they, too, have almost all perished unnamed, how
or where we cannot tell in any single case. They
all belonged to the force which surrendered at
Kut, and it is therefore certain that they passed
living into Turkish hands, but not one word was
ever afterwards heard of any of them. The story
we shall now tell is the only light that can now be
thrown upon their fate.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="tb"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
Afion, indeed, has a hideous record for the
flogging of prisoners&mdash;punishment which was
habitual there, for the most trifling offences,
while the place was under the control of a certain
Turkish naval officer. This man ruled with a
cow-hide whip, from which the offender received
a given number of lashes on his bare back.
Many specific instances are known and noted.
Fortunately the man&#8217;s behaviour became
notorious, and the Turkish Government, under
pressure, removed him early in 1917. He had
had time, however, to add to the burden of the
unhappy men from Kut, whose appearance
when they reached Afion is vividly remembered
by the prisoners who were already there. Some
of them naked, many half out of their minds with
exhaustion, most of them rotten with dysentery,
this band of survivors was received with deep
sympathy by the rest, who did all they might to
restore them, small as their own resources were.
In very many cases it was too late. The sick
men were placed in the camp hospital; but this
was a hospital in not much more than the name,
for though there was a Turkish doctor in attendance,
with some rough Turkish orderlies,
medicines were non-existent, and a man too ill
to look after himself had a very poor chance.
Deaths were frequent; the dead were buried by
their comrades in the Christian cemetery of the
town. All this time, close at hand, there was a
party of British officers imprisoned at Afion,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
two of whom were officers of the medical service.
Yet all communication between officers and men
was flatly forbidden, under heavy penalty,
throughout the bad time of 1916 and even later.
English doctors had thus to wait inactive,
knowing that the men were dying almost
daily, a few yards off, for mere want of
proper care.</p>

<p class="tb">Angora is another camp which began very
badly. In the spring of 1917 (it had already
been in use for a year and a half) there were
seventy-five prisoners lodged here in two rooms
of a very insanitary house, which caused outbreaks
of typhus. There was a brutal sergeant-major
in charge and a free use of the whip.
Conditions have improved as Angora has become
the centre of the working groups engaged in
laying the narrow-gauge line towards Yozgad.
By May, 1917, the chief settlement was under
canvas, in a healthy position about twenty miles
from the town, moving forward as the work progressed.
A little later we hear of kind treatment
on the part of the Turkish officers. By the end
of the year there was rather a large concentration
of British prisoners in this district; and although
they were short of clothing and suffered much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
from the winter cold&mdash;snow was thick in December&mdash;the
general treatment was considerate.
The men appear to have considerably impressed
the Turks by their power of bearing up and
adapting themselves to hard circumstances.</p>

<p>The Turkish Government has announced that
in its zeal for the comfort of the British officers
in its hands, the finest situations in Asia Minor
have been chosen for their internment; and if a
prisoner of war were in the position of a summer
tourist in peace-time this consideration would be
admirable. Yozgad, Kastamuni, Afion-Kara-Hissar,
Gedis, are places of interest and beauty;
the mountain scenery of Central Anatolia is very
striking, the summer climate excellent. Unfortunately
this attractive landscape is buried
deep in snow throughout the winter; the cold is
intense, the places named being from three to
four thousand feet above sea-level; communication
with the outer world (Afion alone is on the
railway) becomes difficult or almost impossible;
and the picturesque towns, with their streams and
valleys and medi&aelig;val citadels, have none but the
most primitive provision against the rigour of the
season. This would be so even in the time of
peace. The difficulties of life under such conditions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
in war-time can hardly be imagined&mdash;difficulties
partly due to the general scarcity of
necessities, but also much aggravated by Turkish
incompetence and disorganisation. With each
winter the officers have had to face the prospect
of something like famine and destitution, well
knowing that they must rely on their own hampered
efforts, if they were to get through.</p>

<p class="tb">In writing of them one must, in fact, put aside
all idea that the care of prisoners is the business
of their captors. In Turkey it has amounted to
this&mdash;that British officers have been sent to live
in places where at least it is very hard to keep
body and soul together&mdash;have there been put
under various restrictions and disadvantages&mdash;and
have then been left to support themselves
as best they might. They have had to pay for
practically everything they needed beyond bare
housing, and sometimes even for this.</p>

<p>After Broussa the most conveniently placed
camp, so far as officers are concerned, is Afion-Kara-Hissar,
though its direct communication
with the capital by railway did not save the
prisoners from severe privation in the winter of
1917-18. The few things there were to buy
were then at prohibitive cost; and the general
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
state of affairs may be judged by the fact that on
Christmas Day, there being no firewood and
twenty degrees of frost, the officers took their
dinner in bed, as the only place where they could
keep a little warm. Afion was one of the earliest
formed prison camps in Turkey. In the spring
of 1918 there were 100 British officers here, and
120 Russians. This is too large a number for the
accommodation, and still more for the resources
of the town.</p>

<p>They are lodged in a number of empty houses
between the town and the station, which is about
two miles away. These houses are in two
groups, forming the so-called upper and lower
camps, though they are not camps in the sense of
being enclosed in any sort of compound. They
seem to be fairly satisfactory in good weather,
but they are very primitive. In the buildings,
more or less unfinished, of the lower camp there
was at first no provision for heating and no glass
in the windows. By the early part of 1917 the
officers had arranged a routine for themselves
which the vexatious, sometimes maddening,
inefficiency and caprice of the Turk did not
seriously interfere with. They had books and
games indoors, fixed hours of study, and a
flourishing run of amateur theatricals. Out of
doors they were cramped, but there were some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
limited chances of cricket. Once a week the two
camps could visit each other, under escort, and
there was another weekly outing when they could
go for country walks.</p>

<p class="tb">The constant trial was not bad treatment, but
the stupid and irritating notions of the commandant
and his subordinates on the score of
discipline. The natural indolence, the want of
organisation, the dirty habits and customs of the
Turks, their inveterate and irrational lying, all
meant a wearisome wastage of time and temper.
The commandant had the mark of the typically
incompetent manager&mdash;a fondness for imposing
sudden and teasing regulations, without the will
to enforce them consistently. Thus at one time
it was decreed that everyone must be fully
dressed for the 8 a.m. roll-call, at another that
all lights must be out by 9.30 in the evening,
at another that no officer should rest on his bed
during the day; such rules would be rigidly
insisted upon for a few days, till the novelty wore
off, and then helplessly abandoned. It is recorded,
indeed, that soon after the &#8220;lights out&#8221;
rule was started, the commandant himself
dropped in at 11 p.m. one night to visit the
officers of the lower camp; he found them all up,
stayed for a talk and a glass of Greek brandy, and
made no further allusion to the matter. This is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>
the amiable side of the Turkish misrule. It is the
other that has since become prominent at Afion,
till the place compared badly with other camps
for the stupid tyranny of its control. It is not
surprising if the officers have felt themselves back
in an ill-managed nursery, with its rotation of
indulgence and random severity.</p>

<p class="tb">Here for the present ceases our information
with regard to the officers&#8217; camps in Asia Minor.
There are others&mdash;Eskichehir and Konia&mdash;which
are reserved for Indian officers only; but of these
little is known beyond the fact that the prisoners
enjoy complete local freedom. Eskichehir was
supposed to be the &#8220;dep&ocirc;t mod&egrave;le&#8221; of the
empire, and the late Sultan even ordained that
the officers there might keep their swords. But
so far as the British officers are concerned, our
sketch will have indicated the main lines of their
daily routine, its security on the whole from the
worst forms of coercion, and on the other hand its
exposure to grave risk and hardship. Fully to
understand what their existence is like, one must
of course amplify the picture in many ways, the
chief of which is perhaps the deadly monotony of
its isolation. All communication with the world
outside is endlessly uncertain and broken. Between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>
these prisoners and their friends at home,
who only ask to be allowed to send them the help
they need, there lies a mass of corrupt and torpid
inefficiency, a barrier almost impossible to overcome
because incalculable and irrational. The
due and punctual censoring of the prisoners&#8217;
mails, for example, has apparently been beyond
the resources of the Turkish Empire. The
authorities have never been able to establish any
system by which parcels, letters and books, might
be regularly scrutinised at the various camps.
These are all dealt with at Constantinople, with
long and exasperating delays. A novel for an
hour&#8217;s reading, say, is delivered to an officer in
Asia Minor; it will instantly be taken from him,
returned to the Capital, and there lost to sight for
months before it is discovered to be inoffensive
and allowed to proceed. For a long while the
prisoners&#8217; letters were cut down to the barest
minimum both in number and length, because
the censor at headquarters could not deal with
more. It appears that it has not been possible to
carry out this work in the camps for the highly
Turkish reason that the various authorities concerned
mistrusted each other too deeply.</p>

<p>The housing, feeding, and medical care of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>
prisoners, the delivery of their parcels and
correspondence, their pay, the exchange of invalids
and others, the inspection of internment
camps, and the thousand and one details of the
treatment of prisoners, have been the subject of
constant attention and voluminous correspondence,
hampered not only by the callous obstinacy
of the Turkish Government, but by the failure
of Turkish officials even to read the communications
addressed to them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h4>THE DARDANELLES</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> dawn on the 9th of August, 1915, the
6th Battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment
received an order to attack the great hill that
towers above Anafarta. The order was late,
hours too late, for the messenger had lost his way;
so, although we did not know it at the time, we
had already forfeited our chance, and were
launched upon a forlorn endeavour.</p>

<p>The rampart of hills to the east of us was black
against the chill, pale sky as we moved out across
the grey flats that led up to the foot of Teke
Tepe, towering up to nearly 1,000 feet ahead of
us. And we came under fire from our right
flank almost from the very start.</p>

<p>The foot-hills of the range were rough with
boulders, and deep cut by rocky ravines. As
we moved on and on, up and up, men got lost in
the prickly scrub oak, holly they called it, and it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
became increasingly difficult to maintain any sort
of formation. But the enemy&#8217;s fire grew in
volume as we mounted, poured into us at ever
decreasing range from the right and from the
front.</p>

<p>In that hour my admiration for the splendid
courage of the men rose to a pitch of exaltation.
They were Yorkshire miners for the most part,
dogged, hard men of the sturdiest breed on earth.
Those who were hit stayed where they fell, and
those who were whole climbed on. The only complaint
heard upon that hill-side was that no
enemy could be seen to fire upon. So there
was but little reply from our rifles as we went
on up.</p>

<p>About thirty of us reached the top of the hill,
perhaps a few more. And when there were
about twenty left we turned and went down
again. We had reached the highest point and
the furthest point that British forces from Suvla
Bay were destined to reach. But we naturally
knew nothing of that. All that we knew was
that the winding ravine down which we retreated
alternately exposed us to rifle fire from the enemy
above and protected us. Hid us and revealed us.
A sapper major who walked with me, after a long
silence said, &#8220;Are you married?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; I
replied. &#8220;It it were not for that this would be
good fun,&#8221; said the major. So we agreed that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
if one of us got out he should go and see the
other&#8217;s wife. And it fell to me to do it; for he
was shot through the ankle soon after that, and
an hour later was bayoneted in cold blood by a
Turk.</p>

<p>We hoped that the foot of the ravine would
bring us out among our own supports at the
bottom of the hill. But the enemy held it.</p>

<p>Five out of all those who had gone up got
down again alive.</p>

<p>We reached the point where the ravine ended,
and in the scrub ahead of us we saw a number of
men who fired upon us. For a moment we
thought they were our own, firing in ignorance.
Then we saw that they were Turks. We had
run into the back of an enemy battalion which
held the lower slopes against our supports.
They had crossed the range at a point lower than
that we had attacked, and had cut in behind our
climbing force. We could do nothing but
surrender.</p>

<p>When we held up our hands some dozen or more
of the enemy charged towards us with fixed
bayonets. And we began to experience that
strange mixture of nature, so characteristic of
the Turks, from which we and our fellows were
to suffer much in the years to come.</p>

<p>The man who took possession of me searched
my pockets and annexed everything of military
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
use except my revolver, which had fallen out of
my hand a minute before, when I had been
knocked down by a bullet that glanced off a rock
on to my leg. He took out my purse and saw
that it contained five sovereigns in gold (more
than I have ever seen since) and a good deal in
silver. Then he gave it back to me, and apparently
told me to keep it. The pay of a
Turkish private is, or was, ten piastres <i>a month</i>,
nominally about one shilling and eightpence. My
captor was a good Turk. Later on, when I came
to know how rare good Turks were, I was filled
with marvel.</p>

<p>Of those taken with me, one was not molested;
one was fired at from five yards&#8217; distance, missed,
and quietly captured; one was beaten and fired
at. Thank God the man who fired at him hit
the man who was beating him and broke his
wrist. The fourth, my Colonel, was bayoneted.
Then, for the moment their fury ceased. I was
permitted to tend the Colonel. He did not seem
to suffer pain at all, only to be intensely thirsty.
He drank the whole of the contents of my water-bottle
as well as his own. They even allowed me
to carry him on my back; and on my back the
Colonel died. May he rest in peace! He was
a brave man, and a good friend to me.</p>

<p>Brief though my personal experience of battle
was, it has left two lasting convictions. One that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
wounds from which men die are rarely painful,
at any rate for a considerable time after they
have been inflicted. And another that men
actually in action neither fear nor even expect
death. As we climbed up that hill on August
the 9th; as we dwindled down to fifty, to
thirty, to twenty; as we retreated down that
winding, trench-like ravine, and dwindled to five,
I was not blind. I was not even fighting, but
only being fought. There was but little chance
to fire back, and only once did I get a bead on an
enemy target. There was nothing extraordinarily
exciting about it. Mostly it was hard work,
rough and prickly, and I was tired. My brain
was quite clear. I saw and realized the odds.
But I never expected to be killed, though I knew
for certain that nearly everyone else would be. It
was not courage, for I have trembled with
fear on other occasions. It is my fixed belief
that this is the ordinary and instinctive attitude
of the normal mind. And it is very
comforting.</p>

<p>For a time that ranks in my memory longer
than some years, and which may have endured
for an hour, we were held prisoners just behind
the Turkish fighting line. We had been joined
by one other captured private and were again
five. It was not a pleasant time. Several times
we were apparently condemned to death. Once
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
an officer took out his pistol to shoot us and was
prevented by a priest, an Im&acirc;m with a turban on,
who wrestled with him and took his pistol away.
Once Derrick and I, the two officers, were put up
against a bank to be bayoneted: an unpleasant,
ticklish sensation as the steel swings back. But
somehow or other it did not come off. When
the Turks pushed we were fairly safe; and when
our friends pushed the guards threatened to kill
us. Personally, I confess to very torn emotions
regarding that small section of that particular
battle, though it may seem cowardly to do so.
I did not honestly hope the Turks would be
pushed back just then.</p>

<p>My slight wound was tied up, and we received
at last an order to move to the rear. An order
from an Asiatic when you have lived for eighteen
years in Asia is a strange experience. I disliked
it.</p>

<p>Two guards with loaded rifles and fixed
bayonets took us back over the hill once more.
We wound wearily and painfully up a ravine
more or less parallel to the one we had come
down. All the way we were meeting enemy reinforcements
hurrying to the fighting-line, most of
them carrying cardboard boxes of cartridges.
Rough, brigand-like fellows they seemed, but
very fine infantry. They were the pick of the
Ottoman army. Twice our guards had to stand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
before us and beat off would-be assassins with
the butts of their rifles, and once I was struck
heavily across the head by a sword-bayonet,
but saved by my topee. The whole thing
seemed then and still seems rather like a
dream, and we walked as men detached from our
surroundings.</p>

<p>Near the top of the hill the ravine grew steeper,
and at last ended. An aeroplane, one of our
own, was circling round the summit of Teke
Tepe, spotting for the naval guns; and we all lay
low while British shells burst on the rocks about
us. The only Turks they seemed likely to harm
were our guards. For, far below we could see
that a battle was in progress. We could see the
white crusted salt on the lake, and the pinkish-brown
of Lala Baba hill, from which I had
watched, three days before, the storming of
Chocolate Hill, like a scene in a theatre. There
were British transports in the bay, and outside
were British warships cruising slowly while puffs
of smoke broke from their sides. These were the
last British ships we were to see for more than
three years.</p>

<p>We had to run over the crest of the hill, and
down a little way into safety on the other side,
safety from our own guns. And for the first
time I think we felt the pang of lost children.
Out of sight of our ships seemed somehow much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
further than did the other side of the hill from all
touch with England.</p>

<p>We halted in safety and sat down, out of
breath, while our guards fraternized with a small
party of Turkish soldiers and smoked cigarettes.
Then we moved on again, and passed away into
Turkey.</p>

<p>Worn and very, very thirsty, we were taken
that afternoon to the headquarters of General
Liman von Sanders, Commander-in-Chief of the
enemy forces on Gallipoli; and there we found
some more of our men with one more officer.
Von Sanders was looking at the samples he had
drawn. He has been accused of many things
since then, for all I know quite justly; but to us
he was not unkind. His staff gave us a meal in
their quarters, and he gave two Turkish pounds
to our men. But the kindness to the men did not
extend far beyond his sight. When next we saw
them, some ten days later, they described how
their Turkish guards had robbed them of their
boots and made them run for several miles barefoot
over rough ground. Still, to us the General
was civil, though he did say that International
Law no longer existed. One of his staff, a
German naval officer, told us that they found it
almost impossible to get the Turks to take
prisoners, or, having taken them, to keep them
alive. We, too, had observed this reluctance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
From Liman von Sanders&#8217;s headquarters to the
Turkish general headquarters was about three
miles by the way we went, and we arrived there
after dark. We were four officers now, all of
the 11th Division, and we did not see our men
again until much later, in Constantinople.</p>

<p>We were kept in a tent for three days at the
Turkish G.H.Q., and were not troubled with
many questions. Our interrogation came later.
Various officers came to see us. To look at us,
I think. For we were samples, and on their
valuation of us would depend their reports on
Kitchener&#8217;s Army. The four of us aggregated
about twenty-four feet four inches in length, and
about fifty-three stone in weight, but I do not
suppose they went much on that. General von
Sanders had said to our youngest, &#8220;Eton? and
Oxford?&#8221; and seemed pleased to find that
his conjecture was right. He knew England
well, and said that he had been in Ireland not
long before the war. But the Turks were
different. They looked at us a good deal, but
ventured no overt guesses as to our antecedents.
One Turkish officer, an Arab rather, and a
descendant of the Prophet, as he told us, had
lived in London, and spoke English perfectly.
Indeed, he boasted that in his veins there ran
some drops of English blood, and told me the
well-known family that had lent it. Being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
ignorant of the law of libel, I will not mention
it here. He was a curious being. A violent
Moslem, but not unfriendly to us personally.
Indeed, he did me a real good turn, for he somehow
or other sent a telegram for me to my wife
and saved her from that awful anxiety that so
many women have had to bear after receiving
notice that their menkind were &#8220;missing.&#8221;</p>

<p>I liked to listen to this friendly enemy&#8217;s
conversation. He had an idea that we had
two submarines in the Sea of Marmora based
upon the islands and supplied by the Greeks
there.</p>

<p>It was impossible, he said, that our submarines
should pass up and down the straits through all
their nets and mines. But was it? Ask the
E 7 or the E 11. Another favourite topic was
the recuperative power of Islam. After this
war, the Arab maintained, Turkey would recover
much more quickly than the Western nations.
&#8220;For,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we are polygamous. We use
the whole breeding power of our race, which
resides in the women. Women are not being
killed. They will all find husbands and bear
children. We shall build up again our full power
while you are still suffering from the deaths of
your young men.&#8221; There may be much truth in
this. I think that all the enemy staff were very
anxious at that time. They thought the Greeks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
had come in without declaring war, and one of
my signallers, a short, dark man, a glass-blower
from Yorkshire, had some difficulty in proving
to the Turks that he was not a Greek. &#8220;Yok!
Yok!&#8221; said the Turkish officer, &#8220;yok&#8221; being
the Turkish for &#8220;no&#8221;; but he accepted the
evidence of a pocketful of letters with English
post-marks, and it probably saved the man&#8217;s life&mdash;for
the time&mdash;for he died of hard treatment two
years later. I remember that this man said to me,
&#8220;They say &#8216;Yok, yok,&#8217; sir; they know they have
got the East Yorks!&#8221; &#8220;Yok&#8221; was at that
time the only Turkish word I knew, and that and
&#8220;Yassak,&#8221; meaning &#8220;forbidden,&#8221; were the
words I heard most often in Turkey.</p>

<p>The Turkish staff officers, even as the Germans,
told us how hard they found it to get their allies
to take prisoners. The fact was that they only
went in for taking prisoners when they wanted to
study our newly-landed forces. At all other
times they murdered them. It is easy to demonstrate,
as I think the following facts will show.
On Gallipoli, I believe something like 700 officers
and 11,000 men were posted as missing. Many
of these were dead, of course, but certainly
nothing like all. Of the 700 officers only 17 were
taken prisoner, one in every forty-one; of the
11,000 men about 400 were taken prisoner, one
in every twenty-seven. The details regarding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
the men I do not know, but the officers were
taken as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>That clearly shows that the prisoners were
taken only to gain information as to the types
of our new forces. But I have further evidence.
I was one of four British officers who crossed the
Sea of Marmora in a Turkish torpedo-boat, six
days after we were captured. In the engineers&#8217;
quarters with us was a sick Turkish officer, a
Circassian, who spoke French. Of the four
British, I happened to be the only one who could
converse with him. He seemed pleased to see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
us, told us what a good time we should have in
Constantinople; society, women, fine hotels, and
other joys. We were extremely surprised.
Then he told us that an order had come to take
some prisoners, &#8220;and we have got some.&#8221; We
were again surprised, but polite, and conversation
continued. Suddenly he said, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;
&#8220;British officers,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I thought you were invalided Germans!&#8221;</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Charles Townshend has
stated publicly since returning to England that
the Turk is a sportsman and a clean fighter.
This must have been said in complete ignorance
of the whole series of damning facts which are
now in the hands of our Government. I have
brought out one of these facts, and others will
appear as the book proceeds. Major-General
Townshend is to the best of my belief singular on
this point among those officers, non-commissioned
officers and men who were his fellow-prisoners in
Turkey. The Turk is a master of the game he
plays. A hospital-ship lying off the coast is
secure from his artillery, because of the publicity,
not because it is a hospital-ship. A wounded
soldier behind a ridge, hid from the eye of the
world&#8217;s Press, has about as much chance with the
Turks as he would have with a pack of wolves.
An article I once read in a Turkish paper published
in French, an article upon the damnable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
wickedness of the Entente, ended in these words:
&#8220;C&#8217;est nous qui sommes les &#8216;Gentlemen.&#8217;&#8221;
They wish to play to the gallery of neutrals,
and to pose as humane fighters. But they expected
to win, and they thought the prisoners&#8217;
stories would have to wait until after the war.
We managed to evade this last wish of theirs;
but of that later. It has been pointed out that
the Turks did not use gas; indeed, they laughed
at our respirators. I have heard, and I believe,
that the true explanation of their reluctance was
that they were found too unhandy and stupid to
be trusted not to gas themselves.</p>

<p>There were good Turks; there are good wolves,
for I have known one; but their rarity was above
that of rubies.</p>

<p>There is one other question concerning Gallipoli
which may fitly come into this chapter. I
do not ask the question, but one of us four was
asked it by General Liman von Sanders, and we
did not then, and we do not now, know the
reply. Von Sanders asked, &#8220;Why did General
Hamilton send a handful like yours to attack the
great hill that commands all my position. Did
he think that I could be so blind as not to defend
it against even a much stronger force?&#8221;</p>

<p>On the early morning of the 16th of August
we reached the Quay of Stamboul.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4>CONSTANTINOPLE</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were rather thankful to reach Constantinople.
We crossed the Marmora by night in a
rickety little torpedo-boat with something wrong
with her screw, and we hoped to escape being
sunk by one of our own submarines. The
danger was a very real one, for it was only a few
weeks after this that a Turkish transport with
a number of British prisoners on board was sunk
by one of our E-boats. But in that case they all
escaped to barges alongside. We were sealed up
like bully beef in a tin, and would have had no
chance.</p>

<p>At the quay, our escorting officer left us. He
bore the euphonious name of Fa&#8217;at Bey, but was
not a bad fellow. And, unlike the majority of
Turks, he had travelled and picked up a little
English. Many Turkish officers speak French,
and a few German; but knowledge of English
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
is rare. What strikes one as very curious when
first encountered is to find a Turk speaking
English with a strong American pronunciation.
The reason is that several very fine American
colleges have been founded in Turkey, where first-class
education is to be had cheaply. Later in our
captivity we were so fortunate as to get to know
the staff of one of these colleges very well, and
nothing gives me greater pleasure than to pay
some small tribute to their wonderful, unselfish
work. But of that in another place.</p>

<p>From the quay we were driven in carriages
through the streets of Stamboul, up the hill to
the Ministry of War, and there confined in a
fairly large room with blue-tiled embrasures and
a very dirty floor. Heretofore we had lived in
tents; we were now to begin our painful studies
of Turkish domestic fauna.</p>

<p>Various Turkish officers came to see us; one
tremendous swell, apparently made up to take a
leading part in &#8220;Arms and the Man,&#8221; was very
impressive. He had the most complete appearance
of gilded villainy that I have ever seen. He
was the first, so far as I recollect, to play the
favourite Turkish confidence trick upon us. It
is a simple performance, and we were simple
enough to be taken in by it&mdash;once. The procedure
is thus:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span><i>Scene</i>: Dirty room. Dirty prisoners in dirty
clothes. Dirty beds. Dirty walls, covered with
stains where former captives have squashed bugs.
(Is that a filthy thing to write? I believe
it is. But this is a history, and I shall have to
write worse things than that.)</p>

<p><i>Enter</i>: Gorgeous official, Interpreter with a
mean, shifty face, and other incompetent
perverts who look as though they were &#8220;walking
on&#8221; for five piastres a performance. Probably
they actually are.</p>

<p><i>Interpreter</i>: &#8220;His Excellency wishes me to
tell you that you are not prisoners, your country
and mine are at war, but we are all soldiers.
You are our honoured guests; is there anything
that you require? All will be given you; in a
few days you shall have complete liberty.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Senior Prisoner</i>: &#8220;Please thank the&mdash;General,
Pasha, Excellency, Bey, Effendi, or whatnot;
the title does not affect the procedure&mdash;We
should like to write letters, to have a bath,
to have the beds disinfected, and to be able to
purchase soap, tooth-brushes, underclothes,
etc., etc.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Interpreter</i> (after collusion with the great
man): &#8220;Certainly, all these things will be
allowed. Is there anything more you require?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Prisoners</i> make various suggestions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span><i>Interpreter</i>: &#8220;Yes, of course. You are our
honoured guests. In one hour, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Exeunt omnes</i>, except prisoners.</p>

<p>And that is all. That is the whole trick. The
keynote is the interpreter&#8217;s final word &#8220;perhaps.&#8221;
Nothing whatsoever happens. The one hour
spins out to many hours, to days, to months, to
years. Nothing whatever comes of the interview.
But in the course of time prisoners learn
other means. Our &#8220;other means&#8221; in the
Ministry of War was a cultivated person, the
editor of a newspaper, who was serving in his
country&#8217;s army as a private soldier, and who had
so far escaped fighting. He was put on to do
us, and he did. But he did, at any rate, see that
our meals were fairly regular, and he bought us
tooth-brushes and a chess-board. Judged by the
new standard we were fast assuming, he was not
a bad fellow. I wonder to what extent it is a
good thing to alter one&#8217;s standards in that
manner. Degradation of principles <i>versus</i>
breadth of mind. It is one of the many undermining
influences a prisoner has to combat if
he would come back to the world a decent man.</p>

<p>The month was August, still warm, but with
autumn and winter ahead of us. <span class="smcap">One</span> autumn
and winter, we thought. We had been captured
in khaki drill, thin stuff only suited for tropical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
wear. So we were most agreeably surprised when
our ex-editor caterer produced next day a
Nubian person, a deserter of sorts from Egypt,
who told us that he would procure us any clothes
we required. Our total resources in actual cash
were very small indeed, but the Nubian explained
that our credit was enormous. Seldom have I
felt such affinity to the international financiers.
The lists we compiled were comprehensive and
well chosen. The Nubian was as one taking an
order from Rockefeller or Rothschild. The
result was the usual one in Turkey. Nothing of
all we had ordered ever appeared. I forget how
many times this farce was repeated. If not four
times it was at least as many as three. At this
distance of time I will not affirm that the lists
were identical each time; but at any rate the
result was. So naked as we came into the world
of official Stamboul, thus naked did we depart
from it. And perhaps we were lucky to retain
the clothes we had. Other prisoners at different
times were robbed of their uniforms, more frequently
of their boots, and among the men, poor
fellows, many had at one time and another to sell
their clothes to buy food. We did, at any rate,
get out of that place with all we had brought in.</p>

<p>On the second day our numbers were doubled,
for two officers of the Worcesters and two from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the Australian Division joined us. They had
been captured three days before our own misfortune,
but had come the long way round from
Gallipoli by road and rail. I know we looked at
them as the bears in the Zoo might be expected
to greet a new companion, but we soon settled
down. About this time a batch of some 150
N.C.O.&#8217;s and men arrived, but we were not
allowed to see them for several days. They were
housed in very uncomfortable quarters below the
level of the ground; bad enough, but not so bad
as the awful room three naval officers occupied
about a month later.</p>

<p>On one side of the Ministry there was a long,
narrow garden, and as our room was a corner
one we looked out both over the garden across
the city and through the end windows. The
view over the garden was magnificent. We
could see a corner of the Bosphorus, and the
buildings of Pera stretching away up the opposite
hill-side. From the end windows there was a
prospect in two stories, typical of the land of the
Turk, a mixture of squalor and display. The
upper storey was a very handsome grey stone
mosque with four slender and very beautiful
minarets, reaching up into the blue sky where
birds for ever circled as emblems of the liberty
we longed for. The lower storey was a paved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
courtyard with barred windows all along the side
that faced us. From behind the bars came the
voices of prisoners and the clank of chains, and
through them we could see a mass of unfortunates
either undergoing sentences or awaiting
them; probably the latter; it is mostly waiting
in Turkey. We used to see arms thrust out with
small nickel coins in the hands to bribe their
gaolers to fetch their owners food or cups of
coffee. I remember one poor miserable wretch
of an albino, with a face like a very, very thin
Angora goat, who used to gibber through the
bars all day long. He looked to me as though he
had gone mad, and perhaps he had. Long afterwards
I met a British prisoner who had been
thrust in there among those ghastly creatures for
a night, and from his account they were a queer
lot.</p>

<p>In the garden there used to promenade a
number of Turkish officers who apparently had
nothing else to do. We thought, of course, that
they were government servants passing away the
time until pay-day came along once more. It
was only a natural supposition; but it was completely
wrong. They were, as a matter of fact,
prisoners like ourselves. People who had infringed
the Turkish military code, or had been
convicted of swindles sufficiently considerable to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
entitle them to preferential treatment. In
Turkey, an officer may be convicted of theft, but
unless his sentence exceeds six months he suffers
neither loss of his commission nor even loss of
rank. And this is wise, for you could not have
an army consisting of private soldiers only.
Even in Russia they do not do that. So many
of them were but biding the time until a
benevolent system should again loose their
energies to prove once more that charity begins
at home. But some were of other categories.
There was one who subsequently was so kind as
to admit an Englishman into his confidence, and
to explain how to remain an officer, with all its
prestige and honour, while yet avoiding the more
distressing features of war, such as wounds,
danger, or even death. This officer, most meritoriously,
had become a master of his country&#8217;s
military laws. A thing wholly to be admired in
an officer. So skilled was he, and so fertile of
resource, that he knew to a nicety the value of
each crime. When war broke out he promptly
committed one, was accused, awaited sentence,
served it, and so escaped that tedious campaign
in the frozen Caucasus. On being released, he
selected from his repertory another crime, and
bravely committed it, this time avoiding martyrdom
in the Dardanelles. Similarly, he escaped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the perils of that ill-judged attack on the Suez
Canal, and, for aught I know, may at the very
present moment be avoiding the infamy of
seeing his country&#8217;s capital city occupied by
the infidel.</p>

<p>I did not mean to digress into Turkish law, but
having done so I will go one step further in order
to describe the procedure which is followed when
a private soldier makes an accusation against an
officer. My authority is the official interpreter
who was for a time the bane of our lives at Afion-Kara-Hissar.
On hearing the accusation, the
senior officer determines what the sentence would
be for that particular offence. Having done this
justly and with an open palm, he arrests the
accused and condemns him. The accused serves
the sentence, whatever it may be&mdash;I believe one
hundred and one years is the maximum for
serious charges; and at the expiration of the
penalty, the case is tried. The officer is then
found either guilty or not guilty. If the former,
he is politely informed that as he has already paid
the price, probably in every sense of the word,
he is now at liberty. The man who accused him
is commended. If, on the other hand, he is
found not guilty, he is reinstated in his former
position, and the man who accused him wrongfully
is beaten.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
I cannot say whether this is a true description,
but it is true that the interpreter told
me this.</p>

<p>And, indeed, why should it not be true?
Institutions as well as animals, even that greatest
of animals, man, must subscribe to the natural
law of the survival of the fittest. As already
pointed out when describing the way in which a
Turkish officer avoids loss of rank when convicted
for theft, perhaps this arrangement is wise, in the
circumstances; perhaps it fits those circumstances.
For in the majority of cases a Turkish soldier is
a more honest man than his officer, and in a high
percentage of cases the accusation must be justified:
in the remainder the officer is probably only
paying the penalty of one of his undiscovered
crimes.</p>

<p>What with the four new officers and the other
ranks, we were by this time a considerable body,
quite large enough to become the living illustrations
of a national triumph. So, in due course,
we were paraded in the square on the opposite
side of the Ministry to our outlook, and were
passed before a cinematograph. I do not remember
how many times we circled round that
infernal machine while the operator ground the
handle, but it was a good many. By the time he
had exhausted the roll of film we must have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
a very creditable appearance, several divisions at
the very least. It was unfortunate for the Turks
that they had not a captured gun to trundle round
with us; but, even as it was, we have played a
great part in the world.</p>

<p>At the end of the square, where it abutted upon
the street, there was an arched gateway, something
like a Roman triumphal arch, and in the
room above it there resided an arch-villain. We
had been in Constantinople about a week when
we were commanded to his presence. He was
a very great man indeed, popularly supposed to
be Enver Pasha&#8217;s remover-in-chief at a time when
removals of political opponents were frequent.
But we did not know that then; we only knew
that he was a magnificent, tawdry and detestable
person. That room lives in my memory as the
gold and purple room. It was hung with velvet
and decked with gilt, and the man sat in it like a
frog in an orchid. We were given cigarettes,
and were then informed that the British Government
was ill-treating its Turkish prisoners so
disgracefully that reprisals would have to be
started. The infamous English, we were assured,
made their Turkish officer prisoners march naked
through the streets as a sport for the populace.
What had we to say about it? Of course we
denied the possibility of such a thing being true.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
But he remained unconvinced, of our knowledge,
if not of our good faith. The interview left a
sense of possible unpleasantness looming ahead
of us.</p>

<p>The next day we received orders to move to a
new barracks over in Pera.</p>

<p>When first in Turkey one is inclined to look
upon all moves as desirable. Monotony and stagnation
grow upon a prisoner very rapidly, and
the first six months are much the hardest to bear.
Any move rumoured or ordered shines like a light
ahead. It must be an improvement, one thinks,
it will in any case be an event, something to mark
the passage of time. But after a year the
average prisoner hates moves. By bitter experience
he knows their cost and discomfort, the
loss of his small, painfully-acquired property, and
the trouble of settling down again. Also he
knows that, much as he may hate the place he is
in, there are many places worse. Still, we were
at the beginning of things then, and we rejoiced
in the move. We were marched down the streets
of Stamboul, with our men, across the bridge over
the Golden Horn, and up the steep street that
leads to the top of Pera.</p>

<p>We passed on the way the small French hotel
where I had stayed nearly eight years before, and
listened to the howling of the dogs at night.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
The populace stared at us, but was not hostile.
If any of them had seen the film of us in our
thousands they must have been bitterly disappointed;
or perhaps they thought it natural
there should be so few survivors.</p>

<p>At the very top of the hill, where it bends down
again towards the Bosphorus, we were led into
the Taxim barracks. The men were given
several large dormitories; the officers had a small
room to themselves. This did not seem very bad.
It was a smaller room than before, and it had no
blue tiles, but otherwise not much worse. Our
disillusion came with the fall of dusk.</p>

<p>That night we fought a battle.</p>

<p>We put up a tremendous struggle against impossible
odds and we did not win.</p>

<p>When the sun set and the light in the room
turned grey, forms were seen stealing down the
walls, up the walls, out of the walls, and all over
the walls; but mostly down the walls. Small,
brown, flat creatures, easy to kill with anything
hard, even with one&#8217;s fingers. They began in
tens, and ended in tens of thousands. And each
one of every one of those thousands was a
famished bug. Each one could wake a clean
European by crawling over him, and keep him
awake long after it was dead by the venom it injected
into him. We were not very clean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Europeans, but we were clean enough for that.
We had not then acquired the stock of antibug-venene
that we had in our veins later. We began
by trying to slay them. We succeeded in slaying
many hundreds, but their hosts were not perceptibly
weakened, nor was their natural force
abated. Moreover, they stank. A bug at large
smells very noticeably, a bug squashed stinks.
All that night we fought them unavailingly, and
at dawn they drew their undiminished tribes
away.</p>

<p>There were three nights like that, and seven of
the eight of us hardly slept a wink the whole time.
We slept a little by day. But had we stayed there
long it would have been a hard fight for sanity.
As it was, our nerves got very much on edge,
and we were not the cheery companions we
might have been. It may seem childish and
hypersensitive to make a fuss about a few insects,
but it was a very real horror; not only the actual
itching, or even the odour, but there is something
disgusting and degrading in being covered with
beastly creatures of that sort, and I have heard
pretty rough private soldiers say they felt the
same when first afflicted by lice. &#8220;Private&#8221; was,
I believe, originally short for &#8220;Private Gentleman,&#8221;
and the old meaning is not infrequently
brought home to one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>Things were rather strained altogether in
Taxim barracks. The Turkish guards were apt
to be brutally rough with our men, despite our
vigorous complaints. One solitary Frenchman
there was too, a Corsican, and I saw a Turk
kicking him most brutally on the floor one
morning. There was very nearly a real explosion
then, but the Turk stopped in time.</p>

<p>It was about this time that I began to realize
what a very severe trial captivity would prove.
It did prove so, and in ways I had not then foreseen.
But it became apparent even then that
work of some sort would have to be done if
normality of mind were to be conserved. By the
end of the war we had blossomed forth in all sorts
of directions, but we were only feeling our way
then.</p>

<p>Without saying or meaning one word against
my fellow-prisoners, or even against myself, it
must be clearly understood that first and foremost
among the trials of captivity comes the unavoidable
close proximity of other people. It
is the prisoners themselves who are each other&#8217;s
principal discomforts. We were all so close to
each other; so permanently in evidence to each
other, and so different from one another that
weariness of spirit grew to a pitch no outsider can
comprehend. Bugs are bad, Turks are worse,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
but eternal neighbourhood is worse still. <i>Tout
comprendre c&#8217;est tout pardonner</i>; but God alone
reaches that &#8220;<i>Tout</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>About the Taxim barracks there was one good
thing. There is good in everything: in a bug it
is his squashableness; in a Turk it is his stupidity;
in Taxim it was the orchestra next door.</p>

<p>At the end of the narrow ground we were
allowed to tread there was a sort of public garden,
and in the afternoons the band played there.
Twice we were conducted by a Turkish officer,
a kindly old thing, to a bench facing this place of
joys, and were allowed to watch the Levantine
society that gathered there. We were even allowed
to hail the waiter as he passed and have coffee
handed up for ourselves and our janitor. It was
a good time. We could hear music; we could
watch children; and we could feel very nearly
free.</p>

<p>Except for this narrow space, the grounds of
Taxim barracks, so far as I observed, were a
graveyard. Tall stones with carven turbans to
indicate men&#8217;s graves, flat stones for the graves
of women, and gloomy cypress trees. And
through the trees gleamed the Bosphorus.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h4>THE ARMENIANS</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> three days of Taxim we were told that
it had been decided to send us to Angora, where
we would enjoy perfect liberty. None of us had
a very clear idea where Angora was, but we knew
it must be a pleasant change from Taxim.</p>

<p>There were not many preparations to make;
no packing. My own luggage consisted, I remember,
of a bit of soap, a tooth-brush, and a
few other odds and ends, all contained in a paper
bag tied up with a bootlace: the sort of bag you
buy buns in. And I was one of the richest of the
prisoners. I was rich in another respect, besides
this wealth of luggage, although at that time I did
not know it: for my prison hobby, art, industry,
or whatever it may be called, had already started.
For some reason or other the spirit moved me to
write verses while a captive, and the first of all,
a short poem entitled &#8220;Captivity&#8221; was written
before we left Constantinople. This strange,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
and to me quite abnormal, habit endured for the
whole of my thirty-nine months as a prisoner.
It is good to have a pipe and tobacco in captivity,
and it is good to have blankets, but it is even
better than these to have an absorbing occupation.</p>

<p>We left Taxim early in the morning of the
25th of August and were ferried across the
Bosphorus to Haida Pasha station. Technically
speaking, we stood now for the first time in Asia,
though, morally speaking, where the Turk rules
there is Asia. We knew that Angora was a long
journey: two days they told us, and it
actually took thirty-six hours. But I think the
vast size of Anatolia was rather a surprise to us
all. In all ordinary atlases Asia Minor is shown
on such a tiny scale that its hugeness is lost to
mind.</p>

<p>Several officers and an armed guard accompanied
us in the train, but only two individuals
remain in my memory. One was a thick-set,
short, fierce man of early middle age. He had
one eye only, and his neck was almost circled by
a frightful scar as though he had been operated
upon by a blunt guillotine and then healed up
again like the wolf in the fairy story who becomes
a prince when you cut off his head. Only he had
not gained the true, handsome, debonair appear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>ance
of a prince. He looked, and probably was, a
very efficient murderer not yet on pension. His
person bulged with lumps of muscle, daggers and
pistols; and I am sure the interpreter meant to
speak the truth when he told me that this
ferocious person was one of the chiefs of the
secret police. He was in charge of the party.
The interpreter himself was the other member of
our party who impressed me. He travelled in
the same compartment with us, and talked freely
the whole way. He was the &#8220;Young Turk&#8221;
complete, and ardent upholder of the Union and
Progress party. When war broke out between
England and Turkey he was in America, and he
hoped to return there after the war. But, very
patriotically, he came back to serve his country.
He sailed in a Dutch ship, and touched at
Plymouth on the way, where, he informed me,
he went ashore under the guise of a Persian. He
must, I think, have represented the mental
attitude of his party very fairly. He was an undoubted
patriot, and Turkey for the Turks was
his keenest wish: but by the Turks he meant
what is really a very small minority of the
Ottoman tribe, and the other subjects of the
Empire only concerned him as obstacles to be
removed. He was the first person from whom
we learned anything of the organised massacre
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
of the Armenians then in progress. He told
me that at Van the Turks had killed all the
Armenians, men, women, and children; and he
would agree to no condemnation of this dreadful
act. &#8220;They were bad people,&#8221; was his invariable
reply. Nominally this man was a
Mohammedan, whose feud with the Armenians
had lasted for centuries, but actually he was an
advanced Turkish freethinker, and, except
perhaps subconsciously, I don&#8217;t think religious
feeling had anything to do with the bitterness he
expressed. It was purely political. The
Armenian is very much cleverer than the Turk,
very stubborn, and impossible to assimilate.
Turks of my acquaintance&#8217;s kind look upon
Armenians as an enemy race, a weed that must
at all cost be eradicated. But his ambitions in
the direction of destroying opposition to the
Young Turk ideals did not stop with the slaughter
of Christian subjects. Quite logically, from his
point of view, he realised that the reactionary
influence of the Old Turk party was an even
more dangerous weed in the garden of progress
than was Christianity. His hatred was directed
particularly against the orthodox Mohammedans,
and especially against the teachers and students
of Islamic divinity. &#8220;When we have finished
this war,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we are going to kill all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Im&acirc;ms. Their false teaching keeps the race
from advancing.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wonder if such people ever pursue their
thoughts to an ultimate conclusion! After
wiping out all who were not of their own way of
thinking, there would remain a depleted race in
a vast undeveloped territory where no immigrants
would dare to settle, even if they were welcomed.
All capital would be frightened away: labour
would be scarce: and the strongest of their neighbours
would swallow them up. At the time I
knew no name for this intense feeling, this mental
obsession. But in the light of time it now looks
like pure Bolshevism.</p>

<p>It seems that I have drawn a very revolting
character. But the interpreter&#8217;s was not wholly
that. On the whole, he was the best man I met
among the many interpreters who dealt with us
during the next three years. He was fond of
some of the beautiful things of life, a lively critic
of literature, a reader of poetry, both English and
Turkish, and, from his own account, a personal
friend of those among his compatriots who were
foremost in striving to rouse their countrymen
to intellectual endeavour. I loathed the man&#8217;s
ideas but rather liked the man. It seemed that he
suffered from the absorption of a wrong tone;
almost from a disease of the soul, but an infectious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
disease, not an innate deformity: a calamity
of environment, not of heredity. There was
something exceedingly sad in the picture he
drew of a great national effort going hopelessly
astray because its ideals were false. But he did
not see that the picture was sad. He thought it
glorious.</p>

<p>For the first part of the journey we skirted the
Sea of Marmora, along the flanks of bare hills,
now tunnelling through promontories, and now
looking down upon blue bays. There were
trenches dug all along the coast, and armed
guards at every bridge and culvert. Far away,
to the south-east, we saw forest-covered hills.
Then the line turned inland, past the town and
lake of Ismid, through a valley of orchards where
the apples were almost breaking the trees, and
up into the foot-hills. This part of Anatolia is
exceedingly fertile wherever the slopes are not too
steep to dig. But the hills are very barren, only
fit for the most part for the nomad life of the
Turkish sheep- and goat-herds. We travelled
through hills and valleys all that afternoon, and
by dusk had begun the climb that leads up to the
great plateau of Asia Minor. The railway
followed the line of a river up the valley it had
cut through the hills. Followed it up until it
became a stream, and followed it on until it became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
a rushing mountain torrent crossed and recrossed
by the line.</p>

<p>When dawn broke the engine was panting up
the last few miles of the incline, and we ran out
into a wide land of rolling downs and farm
country, three thousand feet above the level of
the sea. Having lived in mountains before I
foresaw a very cold winter.</p>

<p>It was not very long after this that we began
to see the Armenians.</p>

<p>As everyone knows now, the late summer and
the autumn of 1915 saw organised, State-supported
massacre of the Armenians carried out in
Turkey on a scale unknown previously in modern
history, perhaps unparalleled in all history. I
shall not attempt any comprehensive account of
this national crime, for the whole story is already
contained in the blue book on the subject, printed
by the British Government, and edited by
Viscount Bryce. Those who wish to hear the
details of how somewhere about one million men,
women and children were outraged, tortured and
done to death can refer to that book. I will only
say that the many isolated facts gathered from
many sources during my three years in Turkey
all piece together in that book so completely that
no doubt exists in my mind regarding its truth.
The blue book is a sincere and unexaggerated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
statement of fact, not a propaganda war book.
It rings true from beginning to end.</p>

<p>The first sight we had of the Armenians who
were being deported was a large straggling camp
of women and children close beside the railway
line. We had no idea at the time that their men
folk were already dead, or that they were almost
all doomed to death or domestic slavery. It
looked merely like a very large, very ill-organised
gypsy encampment. Those women and children
were awaiting trains to convey them hundreds of
miles from their homes into the most inhospitable
regions of Asia Minor. Ahead of them they had
days of travel in trains, camps where the girls
would be sorted out again and again until only
the ugliest were left; and, at the end, a march
where nearly all of them would die from fatigue.
For the Turkish way is to drive, on and on,
wearily on, until almost all are dead. They
did it to the Armenians in 1915, and in 1916
they did it to the captured garrison of Kut-el-Amara.</p>

<p>We passed several trainloads of these wretched
refugees. They were in trucks mostly, terribly
overcrowded, and some of them were in sheep
trucks in two stories, the lower tier only able to
crouch.</p>

<p>The interpreter told me they were being sent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
to a very hot district where they could do no
harm. &#8220;They are bad people,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>There were a few boys among them, and a few
old men. The rest had been murdered.</p>

<p>Englishmen don&#8217;t like Armenians. I don&#8217;t
myself. Turks loathe them. Greeks dislike them.
In the Caucasus the Georgians hate them.
This almost universal unpopularity is no excuse
at all for massacre, but&mdash;in Turkey&mdash;it helps to
explain it. Where the European avoids, the
Turk, having a different standard, slays. To
him they are vermin. Here is a story told by an
Armenian woman to a British officer. It is the
story of a &#8220;good Turk&#8221;; the expression was the
woman&#8217;s, not the officer&#8217;s. There was a batch of
Armenian women and girls driven on until their
drivers grew weary that they would not die. Sick
at heart they grew of the perpetual driving of
these weeping creatures. There were no pretty
ones left, for the most comely will lose their
pitiful beauty when starved long enough. So
there was no interest left in being their custodians.
The drivers grew to hate the work, for
there was no end to it, and no reward. So they
were herded together and slain. But two survived,
a woman and her daughter. They hid
among the corpses and remained there until the
corpses began to crawl. The corpses of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
friends and relations. They had to leave that
place, and in great fear they stole away by night.
There were a few Turkish villages not far away,
and in the morning they met a Turk. This was
the good Turk of the story. He stopped them
and asked who they were, and they told him.
&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; he said to the girl, &#8220;and I
will feed you.&#8221; So the girl followed him to his
house, and the mother followed too, though she
was not invited. They reached the house
and the Turk went inside. He came out with his
gun. &#8220;I do not want the old woman,&#8221; he said,
as he shot her. But to the girl he gave food, and
did not ill-treat her, for he was a good Turk.</p>

<p>Why do these people hate the Armenians so
much?</p>

<p>I think it is partly because the Armenian is
usually a successful merchant, outclassing the
Turk in commerce, competing on more than equal
terms with the Greek, and at least rivalling the
Jew. But it is chiefly because the Armenian race
has been ground under the heel of a people
naturally their inferiors for so many centuries.
It is a survival of the fittest, and it is the Turks
who have made the conditions which the survivors
have had to fit. The whole race has been
moulded by the hand of the Turk. For centuries
he has slain all those who displayed the more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
manly virtues. He has been like a breeder of
sheep who hated black sheep but feared white.
For centuries he has slain the white but contemptuously
allowed many of the black to survive.
Unconsciously he has been a selective breeder on
a very large scale; and he has bred the modern
Armenian. If we ourselves, we British who are
so proud, had passed through those dark centuries
with the Armenians, we too would be like they
are, or not much otherwise. If the Armenians
are protected; allowed to be successful and to
enjoy their success themselves; allowed to be
independent and not suffer for their independence;
allowed to be brave and not to die for their
courage; allowed, in a word, fair play, they will
grow into a fine people.</p>

<p>When the great massacres took place there
was, among the Armenians, one strange exception
to the universal peril. Most Armenians
belong to the Armenian Church, but a certain
number of them are Roman Catholics. I do not
know what happened elsewhere, but in Angora
the Roman Catholic Armenians were not killed,
or deported, which is the same as being killed only
slower. They were not well-treated, but they
did survive.</p>

<p>It is a very remarkable thing to find the power
of Rome exerted in so wonderful a way in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Mohammedan country. And were this the only
example of it one would be inclined to attribute
the influence to some local predilection. But
there are two other instances. One was a division
of the prisoners, French and British, by which the
Roman Catholics were sent to a camp where there
was at that time considerably more liberty. The
other was quite extraordinary: it was the repatriation
of a British officer who happened to be the
nephew of a cardinal. We did not grudge him
his good luck. He stole no march on us. But
it certainly was a most wonderful piece of fortune
for him. He was not ill or injured, and he was
not exchanged, but simply repatriated. He gave
his parole, and that was all.</p>

<p>In contrast to the present-day power of the
Pope in Turkey it is interesting to remember that
a large percentage of the Jews who are subjects
of the Ottoman are the descendants of Spanish
Jews who fled into the Sultan&#8217;s dominions to
escape from the Spanish Inquisition. Many of
them still speak Spanish. They are not often ill-treated
by the Turks, I believe, though how they
manage to avoid it is a miracle.</p>

<p>We reached Angora long after dark and were
met by a Bimbashi who conveyed us in carriages
to our new quarters. The men marched, but to
the same destination, and it was after our arrival
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
there that we were able for the first time to talk
with them freely. This was seventeen days after
capture.</p>

<p>We drove through the squalid streets of a
corner of the town, and out about a mile into the
country. I think we all shuddered as we drew
near a large barrack and remembered Taxim, and
breathed more freely when we had left it behind.
Our destination was not a particularly sweet
place, but it was better than that.</p>

<p>We crossed a bridge, passed a mulberry plantation,
and the carriages halted at the foot of a
slope leading up to a group of buildings surrounded
by a high wall. A small, low, iron-studded
door, guarded by a sentry with a fixed
bayonet, was opened. We stooped through it,
walked beneath an arched gateway, and came out
in a paved courtyard surrounded by buildings
black against the starry sky. As we came in
heads popped out of the windows, and we heard
people speaking in French. That sounded
civilized at any rate. Have you who read this
ever considered what the word &#8220;civilized&#8221;
means? It means a good deal when you are in
the middle of Anatolia. Through a door to the
left and up a flight of steps we went, and at the
top we were met by three French naval officers,
headed by Commander Fabre, who welcomed us
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
so courteously and kindly that my heart warms to
think of it to the present day.</p>

<p>Everything that a fellow-prisoner could do they
had done. And when the Turks had gone and
the gate was locked once more, we sat down with
them to an excellent meal.</p>

<p>Our friends were the officers and crew of the
submarine &#8220;Mariotte,&#8221; sunk in the Dardanelles
rather more than a month before. Two of the
officers spoke English fluently, and the third was
a dogged striver who had mastered a great deal
of our language before the end of the war.</p>

<p>From them we learned what this strange
building was. It was called the Wank (pronounced
Wonk) and was an Armenian
monastery, half farm, half stronghold. What
had happened to the monks they did not know,
save that they had been turned out. As a matter
of fact they were dead. Very nearly everything
they had had been moved by the Turks, looted by
officials and officers, but we came into joint
possession with the French of a few beds; enough
for the officers, the men were not allowed beds;
a divan round three sides of a fairly comfortable
room, a shower-bath, and some framed photographs
of various high dignitaries of the
Armenian Church. There were also lamps and
a stove. This was a very great advance on any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
home we had yet had in Turkey; for, although
a European housekeeper would have been disgusted
at the vermin, they were not sufficiently
numerous to keep one awake all night.</p>

<p>We found, too, that the French had managed
to establish the custom of taking in a newspaper,
&#8220;The Hilal,&#8221; a German edited, Levantine rag,
which did, at any rate, publish the German
<i>communiqu&eacute;s</i>. So we began once more to look
upon the war and the outside world through that
dim glass which was our only window. Later on
we had various other means, but not up till then.</p>

<p>In addition to the large central sitting-room,
where four of us had to sleep, there were three
small bedrooms on the same floor, also a kitchen,
a latrine, and a tiny paved room where the shower-bath
hung. This was an amateur one made out
of a kerosine oil tin, and its existence argued
virtue in one Armenian at least. The Turks had
not stolen it. It was of no use to them.</p>

<p>Derrick and I, who had been taken together,
were now in a mess of eleven persons, quite a
sizeable community. We began to wake up and
make plans to learn French and to teach English;
but that night we slept like logs.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h4>THE WANK</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had now a breathing space. We had
reached the place where the Turks meant to keep
us, and though we had yet to learn that Turks
never continue to follow the same policy for very
long, we now had time to settle in as comfortably
as circumstances permitted.</p>

<p>Our space was strictly circumscribed. There
was the series of rooms already described as belonging
to the officers, and there was the paved
courtyard, perhaps thirty yards square. This
was common to the officers and about 150
N.C.O.&#8217;s and men. Officers were not allowed
to visit the men&#8217;s dormitories. On the east side
of the courtyard was a church, locked up and
sealed. Through its windows we could see that
a quantity of books were stored there. On the
north were further monastic buildings in two
stories. We were not allowed upstairs, but the
men were allowed the use of a kitchen on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
ground floor. The western side consisted of a
few sheds and a high wall, and the southern side
held all the rooms occupied both by officers and
men. These were all two-storied buildings.</p>

<p>The Wank being built on a hill-side with the
ground falling away to the south, the officers&#8217;
quarters got no sunshine, for their only window
which looked in that direction was in the landing
at the head of the stairs. From there we could
see the town of Angora covering its steep hill,
and crowned by a great rambling castle. Below
the southern window there was a second courtyard,
into which a wide gate opened, which was
apparently used as a pen for the monastic flocks
at night; and below that again was a third yard,
probably used as a pound for their cattle. The
whole group of buildings and yards was surrounded
by a high wall.</p>

<p>One very marked feature of the Wank was its
awful smell. In Turkey there are drains, but
they are perhaps worse than none at all. I shall
not attempt to describe this disgusting feature of
all the houses in Asia Minor I have ever been in,
further than to mention that the cesspool is invariably
buried underneath the house itself,
preferably beneath the kitchen floor. It is, as a
rule, ill-made of rough stone masonry. Further
comment is unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>There were several curious relics of antiquity
in the courtyard we frequented: a Greek inscription
on one of the stones of the pavement;
the carven tombs of several abbots, with mitres
on their heads and croziers in their hands; and a
very large stone head of a man or a god with thick,
curly hair and a beard. It might have been a
head of Jupiter, and probably came from one of
the old Roman temples of Angora; unless, as is
not improbable, the Wank itself stood upon the
site of some more ancient religious foundation.
The buildings we lived in were less than a century
old, but the church appeared to be very much
older.</p>

<p>The men had little to complain of while they
were here. Their food was not particularly good,
but it was not inadequate for men who could get
no exercise. The only ill-treatment they had
received was being robbed of their boots while
on the peninsula, and they now appeared in every
form of Turkish footgear, from rough army boots
to thin slippers. When they began to travel
again those were lucky who had boots.</p>

<p>The Turkish Government fed the men, but the
officers were supposed to cater for themselves.
One of the French officers who had already picked
up a few words of Turkish acted as mess secretary,
and a chaous, or Turkish sergeant, used to make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
purchases in the town for us. We had orderlies
to cook and clean up.</p>

<p>Things were extraordinarily cheap then. The
war had not yet affected country places like
Angora, and paper money had not yet come into
circulation. When it did so, gold and silver first,
and copper and nickel next disappeared entirely
from the shops and bazaars; and before I left
Turkey a golden pound would purchase six paper
pounds, while the exchange for silver was little
lower. But at first things were cheap, and we
managed quite well on our four shillings a day.</p>

<p>Some explanation of the system of supporting
officer prisoners is necessary. The British
Government refused to pay Turkish officer
prisoners at the rate of pay given to equivalent
British ranks. This was the old convention, but
it could not be carried out with a country like
Turkey, where the rates of pay were so much
lower than ours. So Turkish officer prisoners
were given 4<i>s.</i> a day for subalterns and captains,
while field officers got 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> But, in addition
to this, Turkish prisoners were catered for at
wholesale contract rates, were given firing, light,
beds and bedding, as well as all necessary furniture.
They were, for prisoners, exceedingly
well off. I know this for a fact, for on my release
I went over the P. of W. camp near Alexandria
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
and saw their arrangements. The Turkish
followed suit in refusing to give us the Turkish
pay of our equivalent ranks, substituting for it
the same rates as were given by the British, viz.,
4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 4<i>s.</i> a day. But they did not give us
any of the other necessaries of life. While in
the Wank, it is true, we made use of the Armenian
furniture, but that was for a very short
time; and elsewhere in Turkey, for the next three
years, British officer prisoners had to make or
purchase every single thing they required&mdash;beds,
tables, chairs, blankets, firewood, lamps, oil;
everything. My share of fuel alone for the last
winter in Turkey cost me &pound;Tq.40 in a mess of
twelve. Very, very rarely we got Government
issues of raisins, sugar, and soap at Government
rates. Sometimes we got bread at
Government prices, and occasionally firewood.
But the general rule was that we fended
for ourselves on our four bob, and competed
in the open market. Had it not
been for the help extended to us by the
protecting Ambassador&mdash;first American and
later Dutch&mdash;things would have gone very hard
with us. As I mentioned a page or two back, the
metal money disappeared and paper sank to one-sixth
of its face-value. At the same time, prices
soared to such a pitch that, at the end, a suit of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
clothes cost &pound;Tq.100 (the Turkish sovereign is
nominally worth about 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>), a pair of boots
cost &pound;Tq.40, a quilt cost &pound;Tq.15, tea about
&pound;Tq.16 per lb., and everything else in like proportion.
But our income remained unaltered in
nominal value. For the first three months we
were paid in gold, and thereafter in paper. And
at the end of the war we were receiving the same
number of pounds <i>per mensem</i> in paper as we
had received at the beginning in gold. It
follows that a deduction of four shillings a day
made in England by the paymaster produced for
us a sum of four shillings a day divided by a factor
which gradually rose to be six. One-sixth of
four shillings is 8<i>d.</i> It was fortunate for us that
our Government and the protecting Embassies
realized the position. Even as it is, the loss has
been not inconsiderable.</p>

<p>This excursion into the realms of finance
is not meant as a complaint, but it seemed
to me necessary to explain how we managed
things.</p>

<p>For the first few weeks in the Wank we had no
further glimpse of the outside world. In Angora
one night there were a number of shots fired, and
the next day two or three people were buried in
the graveyard outside the walls. That is about
the only event I can remember. Probably it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the aftermath of the massacres. The Turkish
officer in charge of us used to come nearly every
day. He had been a prisoner himself once, in
Russia, for he had taken part in the famous
defence of Plevna about thirty-six years before.
He was of the old school, and found it rather
hard to understand why prisoners taken in a holy
war should be kept alive at all. Certainly he
failed to understand that they had any further
rights or privileges. He was irksome to deal
with, and abominably pigheaded, also he swindled
us, but I don&#8217;t think he disliked us personally.
His extraordinary and characteristically Turkish
denseness of perception was his worst fault, and
he was a great deal pleasanter than the slimy
rogue who succeeded him. His attitude was
simply this: &#8220;What! the prisoner demands
something! Damn the prisoner, he is lucky to
be alive! If I feel like being kind, I will.&#8221; And
he not infrequently was kind. But with an
omnipotent person of this kind in charge of one,
possessing life only, it takes some time and much
friction to gain a few privileges to make that life
worth having.</p>

<p>The old fellow had a fad of teaching us Turkish
at one time. He used to call us into the room
with the settees round it, sit down at a table, and
begin to exchange languages with us. As we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
knew nothing of his, and he nothing of ours,
while there was no common tongue to bridge
with, this was slow work. &#8220;Ben,&#8221; he would
shout, and prod his chest with his finger.
&#8220;Ben,&#8221; we would all reply, and point at him.
Then he would go off into something infinitely
complex, shouting louder than ever, and by the
end of the lesson we would have learnt, not that
his personal name was Benjamin, but that &#8220;Ben&#8221;
is the Turkish personal pronoun, first person singular.
But these lessons did not endure for long.
We all got sick of them.</p>

<p>I have racked my brains to think what
else we did in those dull weeks, but almost in
vain. The gramophone records in my convolutions
were so badly scratched that I can hardly
decipher a line of them. Chess I remember, for
Fabre and I used to play most evenings, and we
taught some of the others. I remember reading
the paper to the men in the yard. I also remember
two awful rows, things inevitable among
prisoners, one English and one French. The
English row was personal and particular, it culminated
in a friendship that will endure. The
French row was political, about Caillaux, and
they talked so fast that there was a distinctly
visible rainbow round the two principals. It did
not culminate at all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>Those few things, and stinks, are actually all
that I can call to mind.</p>

<p>How wonderful a siren is memory! As a boy
at Winchester I suffered untold pangs. This
much is an intellectual conviction to me. Yet it
is all set in a golden haze of distance, and there
are few pleasures I prize more than to return
there. And if I have a son he shall go there,
where his father, and my father, and his father
and grandfather went. And he will suffer the
same pains that they all suffered, and will remember
as little of them as I do and they did.
To-day is the 15th of April, 1919, and already
memory has weeded out the pains of that
dolorous year, 1915, to a very great extent. In
course of time, in second or third childhood, I
shall look back to Angora with tears of joy, and
wonder why I did not settle there.</p>

<p>But things did begin to happen at last, and the
first of them was that we obtained the privilege
of promenading for an hour in the afternoon
along the bank of the little stream that flowed
in the bottom of the valley. There were willow
trees there, and we used to peel their branches
and make walking sticks carved with snakes, regimental
badges, and other rivalries to Grinling
Gibbons.</p>

<p>We used to watch the ants, too, and I regret
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
to say that we used to feed them to the ant lions.
Fabre was a notable athlete, a Hercules in
miniature, and he used to run and jump. But
all the time sentries stood round, armed to the
teeth, and we were not really free. How the
Wank did smell when we got back!</p>

<p>Then something really important occurred, for
a new Army Corps Commander came to Angora,
and he was a gentleman. His name was Chukri
Bey, and I remember it as that of a man of
honour. He was an Arab, not a Turk.</p>

<p>The first time he came it was in state, and he
made a personal inspection of that awful drain
and gave orders to abate the nuisance. The
second time he came it was alone on a surprise
visit. Again he made a personal inspection, and
great was his wrath that nothing had been done.</p>

<p>After this we got much more liberty and better
treatment all round, but that I will describe later.</p>

<p>And soon after this another important thing
happened, for some more prisoners arrived, six
officers among them. They were established
higher up on the hill-side, in a temporarily disused
agricultural college; and after a few days we met.</p>

<p>Rather an amusing incident occurred on their
journey up, which I am sure they will forgive my
repeating. They had been kept separate in
Constantinople, the three naval officers in an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
underground dungeon, and the three military
officers elsewhere. The first time they were
brought together was in the train; and evidently
the Turkish authorities expected them to unburden
themselves to each other. Fortunately,
they were too wise. Among their escort was the
one-eyed ruffian I have already described, and
their interpreter was a guileless youth who spoke
French fluently but not a word of English. To
wile away the time, they proceeded to teach this
youth English verses, which he repeated after
them. By considerable endeavour he became
word perfect in a rhyme all about a ruddy sparrow
and a ruddy spout together with the sparrow&#8217;s
adventures therein. Reasonably ribald people
will perhaps recognize the schoolboy doggerel.
All this the interpreter faithfully recited, and
they told him it was one of the best known works
of the famous William Shakespeare. When
they were safely housed in their new quarters the
interpreter came to see us, and he spoke the most
perfect English! He had been planted on them
as a listener. It is hard justly to apportion the
honours. But I think that interpreter should
have a future on the stage.</p>

<p>It was not long after this that we lost two of
the French officers. The Turkish Government
used, about twice a month, to make laborious lists
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
of us, and presumably to lose them again. In
these were entered our names, our father&#8217;s names,
our birthplaces, our religions, and some dozen
other useless details. It was a slow business, and
the transliteration of English names into Turkish
script was not always quite satisfactory as will be
conceded when I mention that a French speaking
Turkish doctor once transfigured my name into
<span class="smcap">TCHARLISTRI</span>. But in it all there was some idea
which we had not grasped; for suddenly they
informed us that all Roman Catholics were to be
transferred to a place called Afion-Kara-Hissar,
a place stated to be more desirable than Angora.
One of the French officers was a Protestant, but
he was torn ruthlessly from the bosoms of the
others, and the R.C.&#8217;s were dispatched to Afion.
We were very sorry to lose them, and the unfortunate
Protestant was exceedingly miserable at
having to stop behind.</p>

<p>A few days later all the Protestant non-commissioned
officers and men were ordered off to
a place two days&#8217; march over hills to the north,
Changri by name. Many of them had only thin
slippers to walk in, and their bad times began
from then, poor fellows. Their bones lie along
the highways of Asia Minor, where they built
roads and tunnels for their captors, yoked in a
slavery as complete as any could be.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>We could do nothing at all to help. We gave
them what we could to set them forth, and never
saw most of them again.</p>

<p>At the last moment, just when they were
starting, it was discovered that they were two
short. They had been counted wrongly.
Turks find it hard to count beyond the number
of their fingers and toes which number is the same
as with human beings. This was a horrible
dilemma. Red tape demanded <i>x</i> men, and the
officer in charge could only produce <i>x</i>-2. But
even as a ram in a thicket was sent to Abraham
when about to sacrifice Isaac, so did the god of
Anatolia provide even for this emergency. At
this time two sick French sailors returned from
hospital. They were only just convalescent:
they were Roman Catholics; they were expected
at Afion-Kara-Hissar. But all this was of no
avail, and the poor protesting fellows were sent
off with our poor British.</p>

<p>After they had departed the Wank seemed
empty and lonely. We now explored it
through and through, but found nothing of
interest. The trees were changing their colour;
the evenings drew in and grew cold. We became
acutely aware that on this upland, winter
would be very severe, perhaps terrible. Firewood
became a problem, and, to feed the stove,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
we began to pull pieces off the more easily detachable
parts of the Wank. It had to be done
quietly, and long planks had to be dodged past
the sentries; but we managed to have fires.</p>

<p>Then there came a real change. The Army
Corps Commander decided to give us very much
more liberty. Sentries&#8217; faces changed with the
times; even the old veteran of Plevna began to
realize that prisoners were human beings, and life
grew bright once more. Accompanied by guards
with sidearms only we used to visit the town and
the shops, and we began to explore the neighbouring
country. It was all hills, range behind
range of hills; a most difficult country to travel
through without good maps or a guide. Just
over the hill behind the Wank there was a valley
full of little farms; nice houses with vineyards
attached. But all were empty, except such as
were full of Turkish soldiers. They had been
owned by Armenians, and their owners had gone,
never to return.</p>

<p>Another place that we were free to explore at
this time was the cemetery which lay on the east
of the Wank. It was not without interest, for
most of the tombstones had been filched from
some Roman or Byzantine ruin, and still bore
many traces of their former adornment. The
great majority bore inscriptions in Armenian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
characters which we could not read; but, among
them we found to our surprise quite a number of
European graves. There were several Danes
buried there, a few Frenchmen, and half a dozen
British, Scots for the most part. The earliest of
these, so far as I recollect, was that of a certain
William Black, Mercator Angli&aelig;, who had died
at Angora in the year 1683 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> I have often
wondered what brought old William Black so far
afield, and whether he was the ancestor of any of
the red-haired children we used occasionally to
see in the town. We had a theory that it was he
who had taught the inhabitants how to make
shortbread, for there was a bare-legged boy who
used to hawk shortbread in a glass box along the
streets of Angora.</p>

<p>So in small things we found great interest, as
prisoners do. Almost every day we used to see
Turkish recruits training. They were a sturdy
lot of rough young countrymen, splendid material
either for war or peace, if only their Government
were not so corrupt and inefficient. For the
most part they were armed with sticks cut from
the willows by the stream, and with these rude
substitutes they had to learn the beginning of
their drill.</p>

<p>The knowledge they acquired was literally
kicked into them by the chaouses, brutal ruffians
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
trained on the Prussian model. I have seen one
of them haul a man out of the ranks, box his
ears first on one side and then on the other, and
then turn him round and kick him savagely.
The recruit would stand it all stolidly, and salute
before he returned to the ranks. In the evening
parties of recruits who had been training out on
the hills used to march back to barracks past the
Wank, singing their marching song, a simple
thing with a very primitive tune to it, said to
have come into popularity at the time of the last
Bulgarian war.</p>

<p>Some time in October a festival drew near, a
public holiday called Kurban Bairam. The
troops were to have a great sham fight, and sports
were to be held. Chukri Bey, the Army Corps
Commander, very kindly invited us to attend, and
we stood behind him to watch the sham attack
develop. He was a fine figure of a man and a
splendid horseman. When the troops were
drawn up preliminary to the show he rode at full
gallop along their line, turned, rode back to the
centre and pulled up short. Then he made a
speech, no word of which we could understand,
and they all cheered.</p>

<p>The attacking force marched off, and we took
up our positions behind the defenders of a low
abrupt ridge. Just on our left I remember there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
was a man with a stick and a kerosine oil tin doing
machine-gun. The grey lines advanced from
among the distant willows, attacked right across
the open, and apparently won the day. They
were as full of the fun of it as children playing at
soldiers. Chukri Bey then made another speech,
pieces of which he translated in French for us,
and the show was over.</p>

<p>I have fought in the Great War, but that is the
only sham fight I have ever seen in my life, for
my training was marred by a period in hospital.</p>

<p>The next day was the sports, and we were given
good seats in the official enclosure, just behind the
Army Corps Commander and the Vali&mdash;the
Governor of the Province. Chukri Bey continually
turned round and explained things to us in
French. He had made arrangements for two or
three of our men who had been left behind in
hospital to have seats in a good place. We saw
the Turk at his best that day. His hospitality,
his simplicity, his tough, rugged endurance were
all to the fore. And we owed the whole of it to
Chukri Bey. When, soon afterwards, he was
sent elsewhere, we realised how rare a character
his was among enemy officers. He was an Arab
and we were told that his wife was an Egyptian
princess.</p>

<p>One of the items was a football match played by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
schoolboys, and four British officers were invited
to take part. Two played on either side.
Games followed, rather like the games that
children play at village school-feasts in England,
bearing to those the same resemblance that baseball
does to mixed rounders. Then there was
some bayonet fighting, one of the rules of which
was that the winner of a bout had next to take
on two opponents simultaneously. A very up-to-date
Turkish officer, girt with stays, and
beautiful beyond the power of words, condescended
to engage the winner in sword v.
bayonet. I don&#8217;t think he was very seriously
pressed. The bayonet fighting was quite
amusing to watch, but the great item of the day
was the wrestling. All competitors, and there
were about forty of them, strolled out into the
arena and stretched themselves. They mingled
together, and moved slowly about looking for
mates, like young men and girls at a seaside place.
Apparently anyone could challenge any other.
Then there came a preliminary hug, in which each
in turn just lifted his adversary off the ground,
seemingly like our boxers&#8217; handshake, to show
there is no ill-feeling. After which they fell to,
and wrestled until one was beaten. Often there
were half a dozen pairs struggling at one and
the same time. Some of the grips were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
very severe; a favourite method was to
reach along each other&#8217;s arms and seize
each other&#8217;s breasts, digging in their fingers
like claws. It looked as though it must hurt
horribly, but these hardy men seemed to enjoy
it. One of the best was a negro, but the
champion was a Turk. At the end Chukri Bey
gave away prizes, simple and useful articles, no
gold medals or silver cups; a pair of socks, a
tobacco box, a knife, and a pleasant word for each
winner.</p>

<p>It was not long after this that our sojourn in
the Wank came to an end. The building was
wanted as a barrack, and they wished to have us
more safely housed in the town itself. So one
fine day we were moved into Angora, and housed
temporarily in a Greek hotel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h4>ANGORA</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> town of Angora is built round a hill.
Originally there was a large castle on the top of
the hill, with walls conforming to the rocky
nature of the site, and outside the castle a walled
town. The walls still remain, but the town has
burst its bonds and overflowed down the slopes
and out on to the plain below. At many points
among the rocks, at all levels, springs gush out,
and this water is very clear and good, a thing that
Orientals attach great value to. The walls themselves
are full of interest. When they were
built, and whether by Byzantine Greeks or by the
Turks themselves, I do not know. But they
contain innumerable fragments of an earlier
civilization. There are sculptured figures which
once ornamented Roman altars, the capitals of
Greek pillars, very many inscriptions in Greek
and Latin, and a number of carved stones stolen
from the fine marble temple of Augustus which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
still rears high walls near the bottom of the town.
So beautifully was this temple built that it still
defies the efforts of those who would destroy it
in order to mend their houses with its marble
blocks. A mosque is built against its wall, and
the cornice is built on by the storks, but the
temple still preserves much of beauty. Higher
up in the town, one of the Turkish mosques
carries its roof on Roman pillars; and wherever
you go in the town there are traces of olden days.</p>

<p>On three sides the town flows down into the
valleys round it, but the fourth side is one wall
of an almost precipitous gorge, where a stream
has cut through the range, and separated off this
hill for men to build on. The place has the usual
legend of a secret passage connecting the castle
with the neighbouring hill. Afion-Kara-Hissar,
too, has the same legend; and I have found it
generically wherever rocks have been crowned
with castles, in many lands. At the bottom of
the gorge is the evil-smelling quarter of the
skinners and tanners, men who proved their value
when it was resolved to slay the Armenians.</p>

<p>From very early times, indeed, Angora must
have been occupied. It is well supplied with
water, very defensible, and situated at the junction
of great caravan routes which penetrate
northwards to the Black Sea and eastwards,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
through Sivas, to the Caucasus. In the plain to
the north-west of the town there are barrows
much like those on Salisbury Plain.</p>

<p>Many battles have been fought in the plain
before Angora, and the city has often been sacked
and burnt.</p>

<p>No place I have ever known has such an atmosphere
of evil history looming in its streets.
Should some prophet (or is it profit?) of psychometry
venture to sleep there, she would probably
die in horrible agony.</p>

<p>Even to the present day Angora is a great
rendezvous of caravans. When we were there it
was still the terminus of the railway stretching
out toward central Asia, and we used to see long
strings of laden camels approaching the town from
far away. They pass with silent step along their
wide, worn routes, tied in strings of four or five,
each one&#8217;s nose to the saddle of the one ahead,
and with a donkey to lead the procession. They
looked as if they had walked straight out of the
Old Testament, and many of the men with them
looked much more like what the Patriarchs must
have been than the benevolent old gentlemen in
stained glass windows can do.</p>

<p>Kurds we used to see, and Turks, and men of
tribes we could not place. Generally they wore
huge astrakhan hats of black, curly lamb&#8217;s wool,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
and as a rule their broad belts were stiff with
daggers and pistols, with generally a rifle slung
across their shoulders as well. I often used to
think what a wonderful experience it was for our
untravelled men to see these strange people from
the back of beyond. Strings of camels used to
penetrate the dim, winding lanes of the city, and
nasty, snarling, tusky creatures they were to
dodge about among. But the real gathering
place of the caravans was a trampled space of
many acres which lay out beyond the railway
station. A Golgotha it was, a place of skeletons
and skulls. For centuries, for millenniums,
perhaps, it had been the place where men and
camels met and exchanged the news of Asia,
mostly of wars and rumours of wars, of invasions,
murders, massacres, the sack of cities, and tales
of brigands in the hills. For all these mountain
roads are infested by armed bands, even to the
present day.</p>

<p>In the town itself there are two or three fairly
good streets, paved with cobble-stones, and
flanked by small boutiques, but most of the streets
are narrow gullies; steep, winding, and dim.
The houses have usually stables on the ground
floor, while the stories above project and shut out
the light; so much so that it is quite a feature of
these thread-like lanes to find each house built
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
with one shoulder thrust out, facing half-right
one side of the street, half-left the other, and
enabling the windows to collect some of the light
which falls along the lane.</p>

<p>I think, between us, we explored the whole
town. Under Chukri Bey&#8217;s benevolent <i>r&eacute;gime</i>
we had almost complete liberty, very much more
than a prisoner could expect. Save that we had
to be accompanied by guards, we were free to
wander where we would, in the town and out of
the town. We used to go shopping in the
covered bazaar, where whole streets were shut
up, their owners murdered. We used to explore
the castle, and climb its crags. We used to take
walks down the valley among the irrigated vegetable
gardens. We used to walk among the hills.
And through those hills some of us intended one
day to walk to the sea. Not now, but in the
spring.</p>

<p>The people were not at all hostile to us. I
think they rather liked us. We used to shop a
great deal. Our power to buy was limited only
by our purse. But we used to shop for hours,
like a pack of women in Kensington, all shopping
no buying. For we had practically no money,
and we had not only to buy blankets and clothes
for the winter, but also to set up house, buy
crockery, cutlery, cooking pots. Four bob a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
day, even when it still is four bob, is not much to
set up house on. So we shopped much but
bought little. There was a large store in the
main street, run by Spanish Jews, and we used to
swarm in there in a gang. A very funny sight
we must have been, dressed all sorts of ways, some
of us with shorts on, one young Australian, I
remember, wore long pink drawers under and
below his shorts and a fur cap on his head. For
we wore the headgear of the country. We were
advised to, to avoid exciting too much attention;
and some of us wanted to acquire a set of disguise.
Personally I had no other headgear of any kind,
except a sort of Glengarry made of pieces of
puttee stitched together. My helmet had been
lost soon after I was captured. But the townsfolk
did not seem to think us strange. They
were remarkably polite. Several officers out for
a walk one day met a man with a shot-gun, and
asked to be allowed a shot. He handed over the
gun; they tossed for the shot; a naval officer won,
put up a woodcock and killed it.</p>

<p>Who, then, it may be asked, were the murderers,
the people who killed about a million
Armenians and quite a lot of Greeks? Well, just
anybody and everybody. A Turkish peasant
with a plough in his hand is a generous, open-hearted,
simple fellow. A Turkish peasant with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
a gun in his hand is a brigand. The lower orders
of the town are straightforward, simple people,
but come a massacre, and they take their part.
Probably things in France were not a bad parallel
at the great St. Bartholomew&#8217;s Eve. And it
must always be remembered that the great drive
of the Armenians was a Government affair, a
national policy. Turks cannot stand having
power. A private soldier who becomes an
N.C.O. becomes, nine times out of ten, a black-guard.
An ordinary citizen who becomes an
official becomes, ten times out of ten, a thief. A
common man who is invited to kill his Christian
neighbour, free of all danger of punishment, does
so. Throughout captivity the guards were faithful
mirrors of the powers above. In the time of
Chukri Bey they were kind, faithful dragomen
who did their best to save us from being swindled
in the bazaars. In the days of his successor, their
vocabulary was limited to &#8220;Yok&#8221; and &#8220;Yassak&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;no&#8221;
and &#8220;forbidden.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beneath the surface of life in Turkey there was
always a grim undercurrent of cruelty. And in
that land there is more unnecessary human
suffering than in any land of the world. There
were dens in the town of Angora where Christian
deserters&mdash;Conchies, perhaps&mdash;were kept,
sometimes in chains. We used to see them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
marching out between their guards to work on
the railway. Thin, grey, starved creatures,
dying on their feet. Later on our men suffered
in exactly the same way and about four-fifths of
them died.</p>

<p>When the men went to Changri we kept our
orderlies, and throughout captivity our orderlies
were safe. But the rest of the men worked on
the roads and railways all over Turkey, hundreds
of miles from their officers, and the greater part
of them died.</p>

<p>For the first two or three weeks of this season
of exploration we lived in a Greek hotel at the
bottom of the town. As hotels go in that part
of the world, it was a good one. Downstairs
there was the public eating-room on one side of
the entrance and the coffee-room on the other;
and upstairs there was a landing with a settee
and a few chairs, and nine bedrooms. The beds
were quite comfortable, but were infested with
vermin, and the smell from the drain was perfectly
awful. This was not the whole of the
premises, for it formed one side only of a hollow
square. The other three sides were occupied by
Turkish soldiers, and the hollow square was really
a caravanserai. Those rooms which faced the
rear, into the hollow square, were the most infested,
but the smell was the same everywhere.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
There was no garden, but a narrow space, cut
off from the road by palings, was planted with
half a dozen small trees, and used as an outdoor
caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>The whole fifteen of us, from the Wank and
from the Agricultural College, were established
here. A certain number of sentries were at our
disposal for explorations, shopping, etc., but we
were not allowed to go out alone except within
the palings, and there was a guard on the gate.
We took our meals in the public room downstairs,
together with the general public who patronized
the hotel, Turkish officers for the most part.
There were plenty of things to eat, not bad either
when once one had got used to their greasy way
of cooking, and they were cheap. But even so
they were for the most part beyond our slender
means, and it became quite a work of art to select
so wisely as to fill one&#8217;s stomach without
emptying one&#8217;s purse. All we had was paid for
in cash at the time, and there were so many
clamant uses for cash. Clothes, for example.
An Armenian tailor came and measured us for
suits, and used to come and try them on. He
was a Roman Catholic and it was from him that
we first learned that the Roman Catholic
Armenians had been spared. He spoke a little
French, and while trying on our clothes he used
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
to whisper tales of the horrors of the preceding
months. All the town was whispering them, all,
that is to say, who were not Turkish. And they
whispered in the greatest fear and trembling.
Even Turks sometimes referred to the murders,
and even they were impressed by slaughter upon
so grand a scale; for it was the murder of a nation.
It was as though England had tried to destroy
the whole of the Welsh race, and was still
whispering about the deed. I remember one
day we visited what had been the headquarters
of the merchants of tiftik, the hair of the Angora
goat. It was battered about and locked up, for
with the death of the Armenian traders the tiftik
trade had died. The Turkish guard who accompanied
us grinned and drew his hand across his
throat. Armenian refugees from Constantinople
were interned in Angora. For the most part
they were professional men, and they were all
Russian subjects. They appeared to have no
occupation, except to play backgammon
all day long in a caf&eacute; they frequented. Most of
them spoke French and a few English, and they,
too, whispered sometimes as we sat near and
sipped our coffee. Greeks whispered of the
massacres, they did not know if their turn would
come next. I remember a laborious conversation
two of us held with a Greek boy, by the aid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
of a Turkish vocabulary. He had seen much
that took place in Angora.</p>

<p>It seems, in writing this account, as though the
greater part of our time was spent out of doors;
but this was not really the case. For a few hours
a day we got out, and we made the most of it, but
for very many weary hours a day we were shut
in. We had no books except a few French plays
lent to us by a Turkish officer; one was &#8220;La
Foi,&#8220; by Brieux, and I occupied myself by translating
it into English. We had chess, and that
was all. When it was warm enough we used to
sit in the chairs outside and watch the passers-by,
and in the evenings we sat in the common room
upstairs and talked. On the whole, we got on
pretty well together, though things got very
strained one evening when we had a thought-reading
<i>s&eacute;ance</i>. It really must have been
exceedingly annoying for the true believers to
find that the whole affair was faked. I know I
got behind a naval man in a corner and laughed
until I nearly burst, but dared not let my face
be seen. Things were so electric just then that
a laugh might have brought about a thunderstorm.
Especially when one of the most ardent
spirits made the rest of us a perfectly solemn and
heartfelt speech, beginning with &#8220;Gentlemen&#8221;
and ending with a hope that our hearts were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
sufficiently pure to let in the light that would be
vouchsafed us. Our hearts were not pure at all,
but our merriment was. We got a manifestation
of sorts, well thought out beforehand. But there
was a lot of heartburning about ill-timed levity.</p>

<p>There was a certain amount of illness among
us, from time to time. The officer with the pink
drawers was really quite bad for a long time, and
the remaining French officer nearly died, killed
by kindness. That is before we had discovered
that it was fatal to call in a Turkish doctor. As
a rule, a Turkish doctor&#8217;s one anxiety is to get
you off to hospital where he may make money on
your keep, and steal your boots. And from a
Turkish hospital all escape is miraculous, all
recovery is marvellous. If you were to go into
a Turkish hospital with a broken leg the odds are
that you would die of typhus. But we did not
know that then. Our French friend was ill, so
we sent for a doctor. Three came, at intervals
during the day. The first was a captain, and he
gave the patient a purgative of the right size for
captains to give. The second was a major, and,
as was only fit, he gave a much larger purgative,
of the size that majors give. The third was a
colonel, and whether his mission was to finish
the job his subordinates had begun I do not know,
but he strove manfully, and gave a similar dose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
of the size proper to colonels. That evening the
Frenchman collapsed. He fainted and was
carried off to bed by our stalwart Bill, the medical
student of the party, a splendid person who was
better than all the Turkish doctors in the world
rolled in one. Much do we all owe to Bill, and
none more than I do, for he nursed me through
several bad illnesses; although, as he frankly
stated on one occasion when I had paratyphoid,
he hadn&#8217;t &#8220;done fevers.&#8221; A real wonder was
our Bill, and I hope he will read this some day.
From about that time until about a year later,
when the doctors from Kut-el-Amara joined up
with us at Afion, Bill was the camp physician-in-chief,
and were I ill now I would as soon go to
Bill as to anyone. He was a born healer.
French was not his forte, but in the chemists&#8217;
shops he always got what he wanted: went on
until he did, or turned out on the counter the
whole of the proprietor&#8217;s stock. &#8220;Avez-vous
ammoniated tincture of quinine?&#8221; he would ask.
And if the man said &#8220;No,&#8221; then Bill would
counter with, &#8220;Avez-vous aucun else that will do
similaire?&#8221; And in the end he would get it.
As a linguist he had a natural perception of which
words could be left out, or put in in English,
without destroying the sense.</p>

<p>Two events happened to me about this time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
which were landmarks in that desert of dullness.
It was in the Greek hotel that I received my first
letter from home. A very great day indeed. And
it was soon afterwards, in late November, that I
spoke for the first time in Asia Minor to a woman.
She was an old Roumanian in a cake-shop, and to
her I said, &#8220;Bu kach para,&#8221; being Turkish, my
Turkish at least, for &#8220;What is the price of this?&#8221;
I commend this sentence to the notice of those
about to visit Turkey. It is one of the few worth
knowing. It may seem strange that this should
be noted as a landmark, but as a matter of fact
I only spoke seven words to women between the
9th of August, 1915, and the 10th of September,
1918, and these were three of the seven. It is
no small part of the multitude of causes that make
prisoners queer, this deprivation of women&#8217;s
society. Men sink back into barbarism very
rapidly when unbuoyed by the influence of
women. They do not want the feminist, the
creature doomed to the sterile affection of a little
lamp-post-loving dog dragging at a lead. But
they want to be helped by talking to mothers,
lest they forget that motherhood is by far and
away the greatest thing on earth.</p>

<p>At the beginning of November we moved into
our house, up in the town, against the city wall.
But a few days before that happened three more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
officers arrived from Constantinople. They
were not newly captured. One had been taken
on the same day as Bill, at Suvla Bay, and the
other two were the oldest British prisoners of
war in Turkey. I specify British, because we
learned later on that there were Russian naval
officers taken before war was officially declared,
and prisoners of war because there were civil
prisoners of earlier date. These two were
members of the Egyptian police who had been
given commissions in the army and sent out to
test the disposition of the Arabs in that territory
shown upon Old Testament maps as inhabited by
the Philistines. The Arabs had turned upon
them and handed them over to the Turks, and
the ten or eleven months which elapsed before
they joined us had been most eventful. I will not
anticipate their story, for I do not know whether
they will ever write it, further than to say that
whereas we had seen the Armenian women and
children setting forth on their fatal pilgrimage,
these had seen it near its end. Their tale was
truly ghastly. But there is one thing about one
of them that I must write. He was an Egyptian,
and by upbringing a Mohammedan, his name
was Selim Zaki K&eacute;n&acirc;wi (he will forgive me if it
is spelt wrongly). From the very start the Turks
had tried their utmost to seduce him from his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
loyalty, and from the first to the last he had openly
defied them. He was the most ardently loyal
British person I have ever known. His plan was
simply for Great Britain to own the whole earth
and run it justly. I forget how many times he
had been court-martialled on the charge of being
a rebel, but it was several. They had tried the
religious business too, and a venerable personage
whom Zaki irreverently termed &#8220;a holy bloody
religious man&#8221; had taken off his turban and
solemnly asked, &#8220;Will you fight against this,
Zaki Effendi?&#8221; But Zaki stood fast, and
became more British than ever. It took some
doing in his position, but he had the guts of a
man. After he had been a couple of months
with us he was sent for to Constantinople and
again tested, both by intimidation and bribery.
Enver Pasha, the Commander-in-Chief of the
Turkish Army, the adventurer, the murderer,
both privately and wholesale, the biggest
scoundrel unhanged&mdash;I regret he is still unhanged&mdash;even
himself sent for Zaki and offered
him a choice between death and a commission in
the Turkish Army. But Zaki never even
thought which to choose. He chose death. But
he did not die, although they sent him in the
winter on the awful march to Sivas in its frozen
mountains to be imprisoned among the Russians.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
There was typhus raging there, and there was
more than a chance that his throat would be cut
by the way. But he came safely through, and
eventually rejoined us at Afion. An Egyptian
tested as was Zaki should have a fine future in his
own land.</p>

<p>The third new arrival, he from Suvla Bay, had
suffered a curious adventure. In an attack he
had been shot, and when he came to it was to find
himself built into a temporary rampart of corpses.
He was one of the corpses, and a Turk, with his
rifle resting across his head, was firing away at
our trench. He flapped about a bit, and was so
fortunate as to become one of the seventeen
officers who were kept as samples on Gallipoli.</p>

<p>I do not propose to give many personal
histories, but without a few it would not be easy
to convey to others what a strange selection from
fate&#8217;s claws we earlier pre-Kut prisoners were.
Until Kut brought up our numbers to a large
figure, every one of us, officer or man, was the
survivor, perhaps the sole survivor, of some great
adventure. Such as one I will refer to as the
Squire: the day he was captured at Suvla Bay
one hundred and two officers were &#8220;missing&#8221; on
Gallipoli, and he alone came through. Such as
Chok, our gigantic Yorkshireman, who, after
braining a Turk with an axe, being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
blown up by a shell, and seeing his
regiment almost wiped out, came through
alone to us suffering from what is now
known as shell-shock. Such as Dinkie, disabled
by a bullet through the foot, who had to sham
death while bayoneted ever so many times, and
who had fortitude enough to sham it long enough.
Such as Bill, who was shot through the neck; and
who, long before he was well, was cast with other
sick and wounded into a den in Constantinople,
where he spent whole days wrestling single-handed
with wounds and disease. This was the
place where Enver visited the prisoners, and
smiled and said it was good enough for the
British. Very many died. Very many were
saved by Bill.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h4>THE FIRST WINTER</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the first week of November that we
moved into the house allotted to us in the town.
It was in a good quarter, about half-way up the
hill, and it was a very good house as houses go in
Asia Minor. In front there was a narrow street,
and the building opposite to us was popularly
supposed to be the Angora University. It was,
at any rate, a school of large boys or small men;
and I think we must have looked right into the
University Museum, for there was a mouldy-looking
stuffed owl there. On our left was
another large house, at first used as a military
hospital; but, when all the patients had died,
restored to its purpose of a boys&#8217; school, small
boys who used to make cutthroat signs to us.
Our right flank rested upon a dunghill, or, rather,
a kitchen midden, a public store of all manner of
beastliness and the playground of the little schoolboys.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Behind us was a dark, damp, narrow
passage, beloved of dead cats, bounded on the
one side by the school and our house, and on the
other by the city wall. The hill was so steep that
the entrance from the passage was two stories
higher up than the main entrance from the street.
We used the back door, for the main entrance
was nailed up. The two bottom
stories were uninhabitable, and by us unused.
They contained stables and store-rooms.
In the floor of one of the rooms there
was a well, and beneath the floor there was the
usual cess-pit. The next floor was on a level with
our entrance, and contained a small kitchen and
four bedrooms, one of which Derrick and I
shared. The floor above that contained another
kitchen, three bedrooms, and a large hall we used
as a mess-room. Above that again was a small
room containing a jumble of more or less useless
articles, a sort of lumber-room, in fact, and a
great many cubby-holes and recesses in the walls
and under the roof. Above that again was an
unwalled, roofed space used for hanging clothes
to dry.</p>

<p>The house was owned by an Armenian woman
who had found some means of adapting herself
to terrible circumstances, and of conciliating the
Turks. There were a number of such forlorn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
women in the town, and I, for one, do not blame
them.</p>

<p>To this lady, who lived further down the street,
we paid rent. So the Turkish Government was
actually providing us with nothing at all except
our four shillings a day. For we rented the house
furnished, very little furnished.</p>

<p>The first fortnight of our stay here I passed in
bed with persistent fever.</p>

<p>We had not long been in residence when some
more prisoners turned up; the officers of a second
submarine, and two or three others. They
stayed for a while in the hotel, and then we
divided forces and made two houses of it. Our
house was already rather overcrowded, and it was
impossible to take in half a dozen more.</p>

<p>The new house was a couple of hundred yards
away from the old one, and was rented from a
Turkish cavalry officer who kept a small bootshop
in the town.</p>

<p>There was great friction over the division, but
the less friction is emphasised the better. It is
inevitable among prisoners.</p>

<p>Early in December Chukri Bey left Angora to
go as Military Attach&eacute; to Berlin. We never met
his like again. Swiftly and surely our privileges
were stripped from us, and about the middle of
December we were locked up for good and all.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
For the rest of our time in Angora we had no
more walks, and our outings were cut down to one
half-day a week for shopping. We were not
even allowed to walk in the narrow passage behind
the house for several weeks, though we did later
regain that dismal right. It became exceedingly
cold. Snow fell, and the temperature was often
near zero. But we were too poor to spend much
on fuel. Larger bills for our keep while in Constantinople
came in, and their amount was
deducted from our pay. We had to try to buy
blankets and underclothes. And we had to store
fuel for the kitchen fire. Gold had disappeared
now from circulation, and silver was fast disappearing
also. The Turkish Government used
to pay us in paper, and as they had not yet struck
small notes, they paid us in fivers in bulk, and left
us to settle among ourselves how to change them.
It was often almost impossible to do so in the
bazaar, and our mess secretary and the shopping
orderly had a very trying time.</p>

<p>In that house we could not afford to have charcoal
braziers in our rooms, as is the custom in
Turkey and as we did later at Afion. The
kitchen fire had to be kept from failing, but the
kitchen was far too small to sit in, it would hold
two people standing up. We had a stove in the
mess-room, and we used to light it about tea-time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
every afternoon. For the rest of the day, if the
sun shone, we used to congregate in the two
front rooms which got a narrow band of sunshine,
until the roof warmed up, and then we used to sit
on the tiles. It was warmer on the tiles than
indoors, so long as there was no wind, even
though the shady slope of the roof were thick
with snow. When it snowed, or was windy, or
rained, or was clouded over it was warmer indoors,
warmest in bed.</p>

<p>Entire lack of exercise is bad for Britons, and
looking back to that winter I marvel that we
quarrelled so little. Once the split of houses was
over we practically did not disagree at all. We
played cards, and chess, and backgammon. We
had a few books. We talked. And we were
silent. Sometimes we had concerts. We were
not much in the singing line, but we made plenty
of noise. Also there were alleviations. Those
must not be left out, or this chapter would seem
more gloomy than is true. A few parcels came,
a few home letters, some food, and some books.
Several of us accomplished the reading of
Gibbon&#8217;s &#8220;Decline and Fall,&#8221; which probably
we should never have done except in prison.
And extraordinarily interesting we found it,
especially the later volumes which deal with the
history of the Crusades and the Turks. And I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
had two occupations unshared by the rest, which
took up much time, for I wrote verses and had
jaundice.</p>

<p>There was a sheet of ice on the floor, where
water had been spilled, when I went to bed, and
twelve days later, when I got up, there was the
same ice still there. So cold it was. It was too
cold to hold a book, so I used to lie all day and
devise meetings and dinners with my most loved
friends after the war.</p>

<p>From the tiles we had a widespread view of
snow-covered plain and range beyond range of
mountains. The ground floor, so to speak, of
Asia Minor is about 3,000 feet above sea level.
That is the average elevation of the plains, and
from that level rise the mountains. They are
bare and bleak, unclothed by woods, white in the
winter, green for a brief and beautiful spring, and
for the rest of the year the colour of dust. Even
in the tropics I have not seen more gorgeous sunsets
than those we used to watch from the roof
top, while below us lay the dark streets of the
town, channeled through the white roofs, and
half-obscured by a mist of smoke.</p>

<p>In the daytime those roofs were not altogether
without interest. Sometimes we saw people
on them, but more often cats; real Angora
long-haired cats, basking, fighting, and love
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>making.
We got to know a lot of them by
sight.</p>

<p>The street, too, was sometimes blocked by
camels; sometimes fierce-looking, armed ruffians
strode along it; and there were a few pretty girls
who had a kind eye for the prisoners. And while
the house on our left was still a hospital, the town
band used to come two or three times a week and
play excruciating music. But that can hardly be
ranked as an alleviation! The University, too,
was a source of joy to us, thoroughly pharisaical
joy that we were not as they. For they were a
slimy crowd of undersized semi-demi-educated
creatures not to be compared with the stalwart
murderers of the tanneries down below in the
gorge. They loved processions and patriotic
demonstrations. I remember once they carried
out in procession a huge lath and paper ship meant
to celebrate some Turkish naval victory: it was
about the time that the &#8220;Hilal&#8221; newspaper
announced that the Turkish navy still consisted
of over 300 units which floated. They must have
included life-buoys.</p>

<p>All through that winter the news was bad for
us, heartening for the Turks. Russia was driven
back. Bulgaria came in against us. We evacuated
the peninsula of Gallipoli, and a spirited, but
wholly imaginary, account appeared in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
&#8220;Hilal&#8221; describing how our rearguard fought
and was destroyed to the last man. And Turkey
began to dream and talk of an overwhelming
force concentrating for an attack on the Suez
Canal. The patriotic Zaki laughed at the idea
of Egyptians submitting to be &#8220;liberated&#8221; by
Turkey. And we were all pretty optimistic
despite the gloomy news. &#8220;You are optimistic
because you are prisoners,&#8221; said the French-speaking
and wholly abominable officer who at
this time had charge of us. And though he
knew it not, he spoke a great truth. For
prisoners are the most optimistic people in the
world. For one thing, they dare not be otherwise;
but the chief reason is one analogous to the
action of vaccination or inoculation. For in the
minds of prisoners anti-bodies to the disease of
pessimism multiply so fast that their combative
antitoxin keeps pace with the worst of news.
This was most noticeable throughout captivity,
and, like Livingstone&#8217;s famous insensitiveness in
the grip of the lion, it was a cheery feature of an
otherwise unpleasant experience.</p>

<p>This officer was of the East Eastern, dyed as to
the skin only by a smear of the West. Once he
had been as far West as Sophia, and on that,
fortified by pornographic French literature, he
based his claim to civilisation. When I was ill
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
with paratyphoid, and partially delirious, he used
to visit me while the rest were upstairs at lunch,
and used to try to poison my mind with his views
on the downfall of England. But the skipper,
our senior officer, took this in hand, locked me in
and him out, and utterly refused him permission
to visit me. He used also to be as uncivil as he
dared to Zaki, who longed to cut his throat; but
this Turk was not a man who dared much, and he
was shut up in that direction also. He used to
drop in to tea, and call us &#8220;mon cher.&#8221; He <i>was</i>
an unlikeable creature. But after Christmas he
cooled off, for the reason that we made him drunk
and foolish. This is not the tale of a select
seminary, but of full-blooded, hard-hearted
prisoners of war, who had not much joy in their
lives. So I shall describe Christmas, and pray for
the mercy of the court. To be judged by our
peers we should be judged by soldier and sailor
prisoners.</p>

<p>We had been locked up just long enough to
hate it by Christmas, and we determined to have
as merry an evening as we could. We were
helped in this in several ways. First by ourselves,
for we succeeded in buying some rum in the town.
Secondly, by the American Ambassador, may his
name be praised, who sent us a real generous
Christmas hamper, with a ham, whisky, rum,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
port, cigars, and chocolate. A gorgeous individual,
all gold and scarlet, came all the way from
Constantinople to bring it. And, thirdly, by the
Turks: for they gave us leave to congregate for
the one evening all together in the other house,
and they provided twelve Christmas trees!
There were no woods nearer than two and a half
days&#8217; journey distant, and yet they sent out a
party of soldiers who brought in twelve small fir
trees. I think they were a little apologetic that
there were not enough trees to go round; and we
regretted it, too, for firewood was scarce. But
it was a kindly thought, and they deserve all
credit for it. I had not had a Christmas tree of
my own for about twenty-five years.</p>

<p>There was rivalry between the two houses, just
as there is at school, just as there was rivalry between
the two separate camps at Afion two years
later. But we sank it for the feast, and pooled
all our resources. Before dinner we sat round
braziers and absorbed much alcohol: very much:
so much that one officer missed his dinner,
although we shouted in his ear that the war was
over. Even that he could not hear. Even the
word &#8220;Peace&#8221; failed to rouse him. But he
came round later, and ate a huge dinner all by
himself. We had turkey, and ham, and plum-pudding,
real American Embassy plum-pudding.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
We had also whisky. We had cigars, and port,
and again whisky. Then the evening began in
earnest, near the stove, all as near as possible to
a wash basin full of hot rum punch. We had a
concert in full swing, when the Army Corps
Commander, the Commandant of Angora, the
officer in charge of the prisoners, and an interpreter
came in. On a chair, with his back to the
door, stood the cook, and he was a noted songster
who sang principally one song. I shall have to
paraphrase the only line I propose to quote, but
it does not lose any of its sense if reproduced as:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>&#8220;Little pigs lie with their backs all bare, umph
bare,&#8221;</i> etc.
</p>

<p>The Army Corps Commander was a dignified
person. He was the swine who had locked us
up. But except in his own person he loathed
swine as a true Mohammedan should. All mention
of the pig family, or of those good things,
ham and bacon, were anathema to him. The
Commandant of the Place was likewise a person
of very great dignity. Some effort was made to
stop the song, for these people had come on a
state visit; to see their Christmas trees, perhaps.
But the Army Corps Commander waved all interference
aside with a superb gesture of benignity.
&#8220;Let the song of welcome proceed,&#8221; he said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
and these four unwanted visitors sat down in a
solemn row while the song did proceed, with pigs
and pantomime in every verse. Prison life in
Turkey was not without occasional gleams of
merriment.</p>

<p>What the interpreter thought I don&#8217;t know.
He was an Armenian who had embraced Islam
to save his skin, and he did not matter anyhow.
The grandees did not wait long. We hoped to
be able to &#8220;tank them up,&#8221; for very nearly all
Turkish officers drink pretty heavily, despite
Islam. But they were too cautious. They and
the interpreter departed. But our officer remained,
and he was our reward. Him we
rendered completely tight. So tight that at the
end he stood upon a table and sang &#8220;God save
the King&#8221; in English; though, up to then, he
had always denied all knowledge of English. Zaki
still wanted to cut his throat, and was with difficulty
restrained.</p>

<p>Thus passed the Christmas of 1915; and it was
just as well we did not know that two more
Christmases would have to pass in the same way.
We all walked home to our house unaided. But
the officer in charge of us slackened off his unwelcome
camouflage friendship from that day,
for he knew what a fool he had been.</p>

<p>January was very cold, and we were pleased to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
learn, towards the end of it, that we were all to
be moved to Afion-Kara-Hissar, where the other
British officers were interned. We were
thoroughly sick of Angora, and of being locked
up. No change was to be expected under the
present Army Corps Commander, who hated us
as much as we hated him. And really I don&#8217;t
blame him very much looking back upon it in
cold blood. British prisoners are perfect brutes
to manage. If they are allowed to run things
themselves, they run them very well indeed, but
they also run away. If they are given much
liberty they walk about as if they own the place.
Not out of pride or display, but just because they
actually feel as if they owned it. I felt, we each
felt, as though we British owned Angora. They
will never, no not ever, not even if they die, feel,
or seem to feel, or pretend to feel that their
captors are as good men as they, let alone that
they are better. Again and again we received
instructions&mdash;even now I can hardly admit ever
receiving &#8220;orders&#8221; of such a kind, hence &#8220;instructions&#8221;&mdash;to
salute all Turkish officers whom
we met in the streets. And each time those
instructions were ignored. We saluted senior
officers, not those of rank equivalent to our own.
If, on the other hand, British prisoners are given
no liberty, they continually struggle for more,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
and make the lives of the Turks a burthen to
them. A Turkish officer of any grade always
prefers to get one of a lower grade to do his work,
and to attend to his interviews for him. We
never acquiesced in this for one moment. If
possible we raided the senior officer&#8217;s privacy.
If that was not possible, we sent his junior to
fetch him. And if that failed we ruined his peace
of mind by continually writing letters to him.
When any outside person of importance visited
us we complained bitterly of all we resented, and
were not afraid. Turks don&#8217;t understand that
attitude at all. Their method is to give strict
orders, to have those orders obeyed in semblance,
and disobeyed in private, until, in the course of
time the orders lapse and become obsolete.
Then the senior officer awakes from his pleasant
slumber, makes a lot of new orders, and goes to
sleep again. In no circumstance will he remain
awake, give reasonable orders, and see to it himself
that they are reasonably carried out. It is
difficult for the Turk to keep his mind, his will,
or whatever you like to call it, firmly and steadily
opposed to the wills of others, whether prisoners,
or his subordinates, or subject peoples. He
simply cannot do it. His method is to be unreasonably
lax for a long time, and then unreasonably
severe for a short time, so that the resultant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
line of progression may be more or less straight.
Thus, diagramatically expressed, these two lines,
T for Turkish and B for British, point in the
same direction, but are quite different in kind:</p>

<table width="100%" summary="graph" border="0">
<tr>
<td class="left10">T.</td>
<td class="center80"><div class="figcenter2" style="width: 400px;"><img src="images/grapha.png" width="400" height="25"
alt="dented line" title="" /></div></td>
<td class="right10">etc.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="left10">B.</td>
<td class="center80"><div class="figcenter2" style="width: 400px;"><img src="images/graphb.png" width="400" height="25"
alt="straight line" title="" /></div></td>
<td class="right10">etc.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It follows that in Turkey there are no standing
orders. None, that is to say, that live long.
There are files, rooms, whole houses full of dead
ones. But can you call orders &#8220;standing&#8221; when
they do not stand?</p>

<p>In a small way, this conflict between ideas of
government made life troublesome for us in
Turkey, and even more troublesome for the
Turks. But we were a small matter. If the
main facts of their history were similarly plotted
as a diagram, it would be found very like my line
T.: and the result is the ruination of one of the
most fruitful lands on the face of the earth; the
production of nothing, save only cruelty and
unnaturally debased races; and the present-day
collapse and disintegration of the Ottoman
Empire.</p>

<p>Although we expected to hear at any moment
that we were to pack up and go to Afion, the
date of our departure continued to recede. We
really had some things to pack now. It is extraordinary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
how quickly things accumulate, even
in prison. We were all anxious to go, especially
the skipper, who thought Afion would not be so
difficult to escape from. He was always thinking
of escape, and at last did get clear away, but not
until the latter half of 1918. The account of
that truly great and successful adventure has been
written in <i>Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>Personally I had given up the idea; my continual
bad health had forced me to abandon all
hope of escape.</p>

<p>In Turkey all moves happen as did our move
to Afion. You are told that you will go, and
nothing happens. Having been lied to consistently
on all possible occasions, after a time you
conclude that this is just one more lie. Then,
quite suddenly, you are told that you are to go
now at once. Hastily you pack up, sell off what
you can, take what you can of the rest with you,
and go. At the other end you find that nobody
expects you at all. Either they have never been
informed that you are coming; or they have been
informed of it so long ago that they have forgotten;
or, most likely of all, they, too, have
thought it was just one more lie.</p>

<p>How the dickens this people ever managed to
run an empire is a holy mystery to me. I don&#8217;t
believe they did. I believe that all real organisation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
such as it was, has been done by Greeks,
Armenians and Jews, by subject people, slaves,
half-breeds and poly-breeds.</p>

<p>They put up a wonderful fight in this war,
despite the dearth of roads and railways. But
they were staffed by Germans, and nobody denies
that Germans can organize. But how the Turks
hated them! With German organization the
Turkish infantry can do very well indeed. They
are tough and hardy to a degree hard to conceive.
They can live on nothing and march all day.
And they are brave. Poor devils, they need be.
They are operated upon without an&aelig;sthetics,
which were only kept for officers. They are half-starved,
and they are mercilessly flogged and
bastinadoed. I have seen recruits coming in
chained in gangs; and I have seen the sick and
wounded crawl with grey, leaden faces up from
Angora station to the rough accommodation provided
for them in the town. I have seen them
leave their hospitals, too, generally in corpse-carts.
If all else fails to kill them, typhus does
not fail. As practically all Turks of the lower
orders are lousy from birth to death, typhus rages
among them. Lice give them typhus, bugs
convey relapsing fever, and fleas the plague.
Turks abound in all these insects. They may be
said to be their natural fauna. But the toughness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
of the peasants causes them to survive as a
race in spite of disease, in spite of ill-treatment,
and in spite of continuous war.</p>

<p>At last, late at night on the 13th of February,
1916, we left Angora by train for Afion-Kara-Hissar.
And to the station there came, to bid
good-bye to us, the most mysterious person in
Angora: so mysterious that I dare not mention
him for fear, if he is still there, it might bring
him into peril.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h4>AFION-KARA-HISSAR</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> about twenty-four hours in the train, a
train that stopped at every station, I looked out
into the night and saw a strange place where huge
rocks rose up against the sky. The train was
slowing down while I looked, and I thought to
myself that it would be an interesting place to see
by daylight. Afterwards I saw it by daylight: by
the light of nine hundred and thirty-eight days
and by the moonlight of many nights, and it no
longer seemed so interesting. It was like the old
legend where the fortunate man is given three
wishes and each recoils upon his head. For this
was Afion-Kara-Hissar.</p>

<p>Afion-Kara-Hissar means Opium Black Fort.
Miles of white opium poppies are grown in the
fields about the town, and the black fort&mdash;the
Kara-Hissar&mdash;is a huge solitary rock rising up out
of the town as out of a sea. The great plain,
which stretches away for miles in every direction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
except the south, must have been an inland sea
once, though it is now more than 3,000 feet
above the level of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The Kara-Hissar is precipitous on all sides,
hung round by cliffs, and there are few places
where it can be climbed. The walls of an old fort
grin along its rim like broken teeth; and there is
a tradition that it was once besieged in vain for
many years. In the days before gunpowder,
provided that food and water did not fail and the
garrison was faithful, it is hard to see how it could
ever fall. We used to argue about its height,
without result, but it cannot have been less than
600 feet from the town to the coronet of walls.</p>

<p>Afion is a natural junction among the highways
of the mountains. The plain is ringed by the
hills, and the passes through them lead to Afion.
Xenophon crossed the plain, and Alexander the
Great. The first crusade streamed past the
mighty rock. And at the present day the
Smyrna line joins on at Afion with the Constantinople&mdash;Bagdad
railway. During the war all
troops from Constantinople or Smyrna proceeding
to either the Mesopotamian or Palestine
fronts passed through Afion. And we watched
them. The only aeroplane I saw during my
captivity, flown by a German officer from Constantinople
to Jerusalem, passed through Afion.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
And tens of thousands of storks on their annual
migration passed by the same way in vast flocks.</p>

<p>It was an interesting place, true enough. But
when is captivity interesting? After we had been
there a year and a half we found that it had
another title to fame, for we read in a book that
it possessed perhaps the best known mosque of
Dervishes in Turkey. The Dervishes we knew
well enough by sight, with their long robes and
high felt hats, like elongated brimless toppers.
And we knew the mosque, too. It was well
built; but it was modern and did not somehow
look famous. Well, if the place was famous
before, it is infamous all right now.</p>

<p>We arrived at about ten o&#8217;clock on a cold
night and found that no one expected us. At
any rate, they had made no preparations for our
disposal. After some delay we were marched up
from the station, about a mile, through the town,
and ushered into a house that would have been
better if it had been empty. For it had been used
as a hospital, and had never been cleaned since.
There were filthy bandages and other oddments
about the floors. As usual, it was an Armenian
house; for, although the Armenians of Afion
were not actually massacred in or near the town,
as at Angora, they had nearly all been deported at
the time of the great Armenian drive. It was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
really a very good house, about the best I was ever
in in Turkey, except at the end, in Smyrna. But
except for the dirt of the hospital <i>d&eacute;bris</i> it was
utterly bare.</p>

<p>When we woke up next morning we found we
were quarantined on account of the typhus at
Angora, as well as locked up in the ordinary way.
But soon a cheery-looking Englishman with a
pointed beard marched up the road outside and
hailed us through the windows. This was a naval
officer, the senior officer among the British
prisoners at Afion, and from him we learned that
much more freedom was to be expected here than
we had known for a long while.</p>

<p>I forget how long our quarantine lasted, not
more than a day or two, and then we were free to
go out, accompanied by guards, to visit the other
prisoners. There was one house, just on the
opposite side of the Kara-Hissar, with, I think,
nine French officers in it; and four or five hundred
yards further on there was another house
with nine or ten British officers, mostly naval,
and about the same number of Russians. Of the
Russians, four or five belonged to the Imperial
Navy, and the rest were Merchant Service men,
not really prisoners of war. In the Medrisseh,
the large old Mohammedan school in the town,
there were a lot more Russian merchant sailor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
officers and engineers. These Russians beat us
all in duration of captivity, for they had all been
seized before war actually was declared.</p>

<p>The French-Anglo-Russian community had
the very great privilege of permanent permission,
by daylight, to use a generous slice of rocky hill-side
as a playground, and the Anglo-Russian
house had a large garden in addition. They kept
turkeys and chickens, and seemed to us to be
extraordinarily fortunate people. And we shared
their good luck to a large extent, for, though we
had not the hill-side always at hand, we were
allowed to come over with a guard every afternoon.</p>

<p>A few days after our arrival at Afion the three
original naval officers of Angora moved from our
rather crowded quarters into the French house.
The skipper had marked it down as a good place
to escape from, and in two of the naval officers of
the Anglo-Russian house he had found men as
daring as himself.</p>

<p>For five or six weeks things went smoothly. A
good many parcels arrived, and letters from
home, which mean so much. Altogether,
captivity was as tolerable as could be expected.
Spring was early that year, and snow fell only
once after we had settled in. I embarked upon
an awful career of writing verses, a regular orgie
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
of production, and it took me so far from Turkey
that at times it was hard to realize which was my
real life, that in the Armenian house, or the wider
one among the forests of Ceylon, where I wandered
far and free. Buds were shooting, the sap
began to sting in the veins of the trees, and in the
caves the starlings built their nests. Spring is a
season of charm wherever one may be, but in
Turkey even that paradise contains a serpent, for
the season of awakening rouses the things that
bite from their winter sleep, and lying awake at
night one can hear the prisoners stir and scratch
themselves.</p>

<p>We had arrived at Afion so completely penniless
that the Turkish Commandant, at our
request, sent a wire to the American Ambassador
asking for money. The Ambassador rose to the
occasion and sent up &pound;Tq.3 a head. Prices had
already begun the giddy climb I have already indicated,
and our Turkish pay was already hardly
enough to keep body and soul together. The
three pounds became a monthly grant, later it was
increased to five, and before we left Turkey it had
become eighteen. Let no one think that on this
we were rich. But it was a great thing to feel
that our plight was not forgotten.</p>

<p>Some of the adventures that had landed prisoners
at Angora have been briefly described.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Let me give a few of those that had brought
others to Afion. The first I must mention is that
of an Australian observer, for it tells of a very
gallant deed performed by one of our enemies,
and even the bitterness of war should not be
allowed to obscure glorious deeds. In December
one of our aeroplanes crashed into the sea about a
mile, more or less, from the coast of the Gallipoli
peninsula held by the Turks. The pilot sank,
but the observer was buoyed up by his life-saving
waistcoat until he lost consciousness in the bitterly
cold water. When he came to his senses again he
found himself ashore, a prisoner, and he was told
that a German officer had swum out and brought
him in: swum out into that December sea to save
an enemy. Let that stand to the credit of Germany,
and the other story I shall tell to the discredit
of Turkey. It is the tale of Joe, a sturdy
Yorkshire sailor man, a naval reserve officer, who
was sent into a bay on the southern coast of
Anatolia in command of a boat. They hoped to
locate a submarine base, but they were ambushed
instead. Joe was hit in the neck by a great lump
of a Snyder bullet, which had first passed through
the side of the boat. The survivors were captured,
and Joe, who rode as a sailor, travelled
many painful miles on horseback. He was
operated on in the most primitive fashion, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
being held down by soldiers while a Turkish
doctor lugged the bullet by main force from its
lodging place at the base of his jaw. Finally he
reached the civilised town of Smyrna, and was
there confined in the local war office, a large
building facing one of the main streets. Just
below his window was the window of the office
used by the Commandant of the place. For
three days and nights Joe was not allowed out of
that room for any purpose whatsoever. There
was no convenience of any sort in the room, but
all his demands to be allowed out, even for five
minutes, were met by a fixed bayonet. Still,
there was the window, and Joe was a clean person.
Eventually the high and mighty person in the
room below complained, and his complaint
brought Joe&#8217;s sufferings to an end. It is disgusting
to write of these things, but captivity
among a disgusting people is a disgusting fact.
Why should white books and blue books have the
monopoly?</p>

<p>In the last week of March we had exciting
news. The skipper and two other naval officers
had gone. They simply got out of their windows
at night, rendezvoused on the hill-side, and struck
for the coast. They had made ample preparation
in the way of training, and they carried enough
food to last them for two weeks. The skipper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
was in the French house, and he had not told
them his plan, so they were taken by complete
surprise. But they rose to the occasion like men,
and showed the greatest skill in leading the Turks
gently away from the scent. We all thought
them jolly good sportsmen. So successfully was
the escape concealed, and so lax were the guards,
that it was four days before the Turks discovered
that they were three prisoners short. Even then
they could not believe it. They looked in the
beds and under them, and called plaintively in
odd corners, hoping the whole thing was a joke.
It was only the letter to the Commandant which
had been left behind that finally convinced them.
Then there was the devil to pay.</p>

<p>In Turkey it was not the guards that kept the
prisoners in, but the country. Guards there were
in plenty, but they were often lax and until this
escape there were no regular roll calls. But the
country is a terrifically hard place to get out of.
To begin with, it is no easy matter to find one&#8217;s
way through mountains with only a small-scale
map. I doubt if the country has ever been properly
surveyed. Then there is the language
difficulty and the cutthroat character of the inhabitants.
Water, too, is scarce, and food unobtainable.
And the size of the country is vastly
greater than most people seem to imagine. Asia
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Minor is roughly 600 miles long and 400 miles
broad: a larger country than Spain. And it had
no frontier which abutted upon friendly country
nearer than the Caucasus, an almost hopeless
journey to attempt. East there are the Taurus
mountains, and beyond them desert, so that
direction is out of the question. North, west,
and south there is the sea. And our information
was that very few boats were likely to be available.
So that even when a party overcame the great
difficulties of the land journey, and reached
the coast, there was always a very strong
probability of their having to give themselves
up to get food.</p>

<p>Two days after this escape had taken place, and
two days before the Turks discovered it, a new
party of prisoners arrived in Afion. It was hard
luck that they should have come at such a time,
for they were very worn and required good treatment.
There were a few men and about nine
officers, all from the Mesopotamian front. They
had been taken at different times, and had joined
up on the way. It was always the prisoners from
the Mesopotamian front who had the worst time
on the journey. For, in those days, the Bagdad
railway stopped short hundreds of miles from the
fighting line, and prisoners had to make the awful
desert marches as best they could. Six of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
had come down out of the sky, and two had been
taken in a stranded barge during the retreat of the
6th Division to Kut-el-Amara. Each had his
separate adventure and wonderful escape. In
few places in the world can so varied a body of
adventurers have been gathered as there were at
Afion then. We had British, French, Russians,
Ukrainians, Poles, Black Sea Greeks, Jews, and
Russian Italians, besides all sorts of obscure Baltic
and Eastern European people. The Roumanians
and Serbs did not come until later. There were
men who had dropped from the heavens, and men
who had risen out from the depths of the sea;
men from the Dardanelles, from Mesopotamia,
from the Sinai Peninsula, and from the plain of
Troy. Later on, we had additions from Persia,
Palestine, and the Caucasus. Between us we
had seen and wandered over most of Europe,
Asia, Africa, America, and the Southern Seas;
and we spoke most of the tongues of the earth,
and some others. Had we combined, we might
have written a pretty good guide book to the
world; its hills and its heavens, its cities and its
wide spaces; and we would have puzzled the
builders of Babel.</p>

<p>To live among us was a liberal education, and
some of us were boys who had hardly left school
when war began. And the setting of this drama
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
was a dingy, dirty Turkish town, with mud-coloured,
flat-topped houses, and narrow,
wretched streets.</p>

<p>The new-comers had nothing but what they
stood up in. One, a short, stout man, had been
stripped naked when he was captured, and had
been led before the Turkish general dressed only
in a sack given him in charity. Since that, however,
he had succeeded in getting some clothes
more suitable to his considerable dignity: &#8220;The
Admiral,&#8221; we used to call him: he was a member
of the Royal Indian Marine. Several were unwell,
and all were in need of good food and a rest. One
of them used to tell a story of the attention received
on the journey from a Turkish doctor; a
story of the kind we grew to know as typically
Turkish. This officer attended a Turkish hospital
to have an ulcer in his leg dressed. The bandage
seemed a bit more than secondhand, and the
officer asked for a clean one. But the Turkish
doctor refused, assuring him, in French, that it
was <i>tout &agrave; fait st&eacute;riliz&eacute;</i>, absolutely sterilized. So
it was applied. But on the way home the officer
felt it crawl, and, removing it, found that it contained
nine lice. Is it any wonder that typhus
was rife?</p>

<p>In so far as it was possible, we had to fit our
new friends out, for, of course, the Turks gave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
them nothing but a bare Armenian house, which
cost them nothing. What our captors would
have done with us all if they had not prepared
homes for us by slaying the Armenians it is hard
to imagine. Probably they would not have been
troubled to keep us at all. Those poor Armenians
were our sacrifice.</p>

<p>We shared out whatever few articles of clothes,
pipes, tobacco, and food we could spare, and the
new-comers prepared to take a rest cure. But
they were doomed to disappointment. The next
two months were certainly the most trying I have
ever spent in my life. When at last the Commandant
did discover that three officers were missing,
there was a tremendous uproar. The first
thing that happened was that the Commandant,
whose duty it was to safeguard the prisoners, telegraphed
to Constantinople resigning his job, and
stating that he had handed over to a vicious old
gentleman, known as the Kolassi, who was second
in command. He hoped in this way to land the
Kolassi with the responsibility of the escape. But
the Kolassi was not fool enough to take over short
measure, and the Commandant was obliged to
retain his command pending inquiry. Of course,
we were all locked up, and inter-house communication
completely prevented. The place bristled
with bayonets. Then we were all ordered to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
pack up and be prepared to move in half-an-hour.
The small Turkish naval officer who was bearing
the brunt of his superior&#8217;s wrath waxed almost
tearful as he lectured the occupants of the French
house on the sin of lying, and told them of the
awful punishments of hell. All sorts of intrigues
went on among the Turks, and the blame of the
escape was shuffled round like the game of Old
Maid. No one had the very slightest idea when
they had gone, where they had gone, or how they
had gone. I doubt if they know to this day how
long a start they had. The Commandant, in his
wriggles to avoid punishment, did a most dastardly
thing, a typically Turkish thing: for he reported
officially that the officers who had escaped had
been on parole and had broken it. This was a
downright lie. One of the fugitives had been
senior British officer in the camp, and the Commandant
had asked him to give a parole for the
whole lot of us; but he had immediately and unhesitatingly
refused to do anything of the kind.
This lie was calculated to put the prisoners who
had escaped in a very perilous position if
recaptured, and I have no doubt at all
that it affected the treatment meted out to
the rest of us.</p>

<p>When we had hastily packed up we were mustered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
in a street in the desolate Armenian quarter.
Not only the British, but all the other nationalities
too, including a large number of Russian
merchant sailor men whom we had never seen
before. Here we were carefully counted, and
were then marched away in the direction of the
Kara-Hissar, the wise among us carrying everything
we could. It is folly to be separated from
one&#8217;s baggage in Turkey.</p>

<p>Right under the Kara-Hissar, so close that a
stone thrown strongly out from above might
crash through its roof, was an Armenian church.
A fairly large building of grey stone with iron-barred
windows and an iron door. Outside the
door was a very small courtyard paved with rough
slabs of stone, and along one side of the church
ran a stone-flagged pathway, flanked by a narrow
strip of ground on which grew two pear trees and
an acacia. Opposite to the church, on the other
side of the tiny courtyard, was a tall white building
which had been an Armenian school. This
church was selected as our prison. It was the
only place in the town which could have held us,
except the Medrisseh.</p>

<p>As we approached the church, up a steep street
and a flight of steps, we passed a number of unfortunate
Armenian women and children who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
had been turned out to make room for us. They
sat by the road with their little bundles, looking
very miserable indeed, and I am sure we did not want
to rob them of their refuge.</p>

<p>We all, officers and orderlies, marched into the
church, and the iron door was closed. There
were guards outside the door and inside the door,
and guards on the flagged path without. At the
western end of the church were two galleries, one
above the other; one was given to our orderlies,
and the other had an armed guard in it. There
were over a hundred of us in the church, most of
us with home-made beds, some with chairs, tables,
basins, boxes, and cooking pots. The older prisoners
had by this time made benches and mess
tables and other pieces of furniture, and there
were two dogs and a cat. By the time that carts
had brought up the last of our things, the place
was so full that one could hardly move. We kept
a clear passage way down the centre, from the
door to the altar, and the remainder of the space
was thronged with all manner of men and all
manner of objects precious to their owners. Four
Russian naval officers were the luckiest, for they
were given a vestry to themselves.</p>

<p>That night, while the French and British slept,
patrols of Russians took it in turns to keep watch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
for the massacre they expected. Up and down
the central aisle they marched, two at a time,
until dawn showed that our heads were still on our
shoulders. They knew the Turks better than we,
but we loved our sleep.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h4>THE ARMENIAN CHURCH</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the next two weeks we were not allowed
out of the church at all, not even into the little
courtyard. Three at a time we were escorted by
sentries to the latrine beneath the school opposite,
and that was the only momentary glimpse we had
of the outer world, save what little could be seen
through the barred windows. We were treated
exactly as the Turks treat their criminals. And
after a few days even that small crossing beneath
the sky was denied us, for they built a new latrine,
a most slipshod, amateur affair, up against the wall
of the church, where there was a small door.
Fortunately, the building was high in proportion
to its floor space, and some of the windows were
broken.</p>

<p>Typhus broke out among us, and two people
died; one Russian, and one British orderly.
But, by the grace of God, the plague stopped
there, as though by magic. Fortunately, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
were clean when we went in. But the very dust
of the place grew septic, and small cuts and grazes
grew into sores that were hard to heal.</p>

<p>The Commandant was superseded by a hard-faced
man whose service had been chiefly in the
wilds of Southern Arabia. This person&#8217;s name was
Masl&ucirc;m Bey, and I watch the newspapers daily
to see some notice that he has been hanged, but
so far I have watched in vain. The charges
against him are in the hands of the Government,
and I trust his doom is sure. But of that later,
if indeed it can be put into a book at all.</p>

<p>Roll call was now held daily, twice a day at
first, and in the beginning it was, as it ought to be,
very strict. Each person, as his name was called,
had to walk up and be recognized. But later on,
like all things Turkish, it lapsed into a matter of
form, satisfied by an incoherent &#8220;Hullo!&#8221; and
an arm waved from behind a crowd.</p>

<p>Each group of friends formed a mess, which
had its table in some corner of the church, or on
the altar platform; and on the floor beds were
grouped in rows or square kraals, with their
owners&#8217; belongings ranged close by. Order of
a sort grew out of chaos. The orderlies were
luckier than the officers, for they cooked against
the wall of the church outside, and a certain number
of them were allowed to go shopping so many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
days a week. For, as the Turks could not undertake
to feed us, they had to permit our orderlies
to go to the bazaar. These orderlies were really
rather wonderful fellows. They managed to pick
up enough kitchen Turkish to bargain with the
shopkeepers; they knew the ruling rates of all
principal articles of food; kept wonderful accounts,
despite the dearth of change; chaffed their
guards, and were very popular in the town. One
could not but have the highest admiration for
them. And our cooks, too, did marvels. Led
by a French sailor, who in private life was a chef
at the Jockey Club in Paris, they became quite
expert in dishing up the tasteless stuffs that
Turks live on. And, despite some perfectly
appalling rows, they kept their heads and their
tempers.</p>

<p>There never was such a pandemonium as that
church! You can&#8217;t lock up a lot of hot-blooded
men and starve them of everything that living
means without outbreaks of a sort. Not that
there were many quarrels among officers: they
were very rare indeed, but the noise, and uproar,
and shouting, singing, and drinking until all
hours of the early morning made the place like a
thieves&#8217; kitchen in an old story-book. Hogarth
could have painted it, but I don&#8217;t know who could
have described it. Certainly I can&#8217;t. Except
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
for a few hours before dawn, when there was a
hush, the place was always full of noise. Drinking
parties, gambling parties, singing parties,
shouting parties: people learning languages,
people arguing, people carpentering, and, in the
midst of it all, people thinking out problems in
silence, people reading, people writing. I used
to sit on my bed and write verses all day long
sometimes. Another officer wrote two plays
while we were there, and, what is more, rehearsed
and produced them. And in that place the
Russians made great music. They are a wonderful
people in that way. Where the Russians
gather together, there you have a choir. And
the place was full of musical instruments, violins,
guitars, mandolines; played by masters, played
by learners, and played by people who did not and
never could learn.</p>

<p>The worst feature was the heavy drinking. A
good many of us thought that the Turks would,
in the circumstances, have been wise to forbid
liquor. But they could not resist the chance of
making money, and it flowed in. Beastly native
spirit for the most part, and synthetic violet-flavoured
Greek brandy: some good stuff, too,
ordered from Constantinople, and paid for by
cheque. &#8220;Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow
we die,&#8221; was the motto of that place. And, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Jove! we did. There were dinners and there
were suppers, for many parcels had come in, and
there were &#8220;blinds.&#8221; People had birthdays;
nation feasted nation; or nations feasted themselves.
Less quiet than Niagara Falls was that
place and nearly as wet. I regret much of this,
but do not condemn it. Let no one judge the
events of a time like that unless he or she is quite
certain he knows what it was like in its entirety.
There were men, keen, ardent, fighting men, in
the prime of their age, robbed of everything that
goes to ballast life. They were held back from
that which they had set out to do, to fight for their
country. The regulars knew that their whole
career perhaps was ruined, that all the chances of
the war were not for them, and that stagnation in
their chosen profession was the price of their ill-fortune.
The civilians who had donned uniform
for the great adventure knew that their sacrifice
had been in vain, and that there was no great
adventure for them any more. The older men
knew that their businesses were going to ruin,
and the younger knew that they were missing the
most important years of their training. All this
made gunpowder of men&#8217;s souls. And we were
starved, not of bread, but of all else that life holds
good. Starved of work, starved of amusement,
starved of news of a world in the making, starved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
of the society of women, starved of freedom itself.
I do not think that many outside people are fit to
condemn the excesses of that place.</p>

<p>There was one man, not an Englishman, who
slept all day. But if one awoke in the silent hour
one could see him with a little lamp by his side,
smoking pipe after pipe of opium. I think the
other way was better than that.</p>

<p>It must be added that the French, as a body,
behaved extraordinarily well. And with that I
will change the subject.</p>

<p>Apart from the noise, the place was intensely
irritating to live in. We were so very close to
each other. It is unpleasant to be cooped up
with too much of one&#8217;s fellow man. The sweetest
temper would revolt in time. And we were of
such wide varieties as regards personal habits. It
is the small habits that are sharp enough to prick.
But, looking back at captivity, I have often felt
horribly small-minded, and I daresay a lot of
others have too.</p>

<p>After two weeks&#8217; complete confinement, one
day the doors were opened, and we were made free
of the tiny courtyard and the flagged path outside.
When we were all out at once there was hardly
room to turn round, but it was a very great improvement.</p>

<p>The yard, about ten yards square, was used for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
everything, from football to boxing. Someone
had received a set of gloves in a parcel, and they
were a godsend. There used to be some very
pretty scraps in the mornings, and some very hefty
slogging matches. Several of the better performers
set up schools of pugilism. It was very
good fun, but the filthy drain oozed in the courtyard,
and the very dust was poisonous. Several
officers got very sore eyes, and the only thing to
do with a scratch was to dab it with iodine at
once.</p>

<p>I remember George, a Russian Pole with a fiery
nature, sitting on a stone by me one day and
watching a ferocious but perfectly good-tempered
round which drew much blood. He was intensely
interested and thought it a noble sport&mdash;for
Britishers. For, as he said frankly, if anyone
were to hit him on the nose like that he would not
feel his honour satisfied until he had exchanged
shots with the aggressor. This shows what different
angles of view different people in that church
had.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, two things hung in the balance,
and we hungered for news of both.</p>

<p>The three daring escapers had not yet been
rounded up, and Kut was still besieged.</p>

<p>After eighteen days of marching through
mountains, the three came within sight of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
sea. But they were doomed to failure. They
could not get down the precipitous gorge by
which their guiding river plunged from the mountains,
and they had not enough food to go back
and round by another way. So they bought food
from a shepherd, were given away, and recaptured.
It was a sad end to a very brave attempt.
Then the despicable meanness of the late Commandant&#8217;s
lie began to tell against them. They
were treated as prisoners who had broken their
word of honour, and cast into a filthy dungeon in
Constantinople. There they awaited trial for over
six months. Then they were court-martialled,
and that, at any rate, should have been final. But
it was far from it. The court found them guilty
of attempting to escape, and gave them a not
unjust sentence of two weeks&#8217; confinement. (I
think the senior officer got three weeks, but it is
immaterial.) A sentence like this, if given at the
start and adhered to, would have been just. But
they had already spent half a year in gaol, and
they spent three more months there before they
were sent back among other British prisoners.
They only got out when they did by giving their
parole. They had to give it. Probably they
would otherwise have died or gone mad. Later
on they withdrew their parole, got the withdrawal
officially receipted this time, and one, if not more,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
of them escaped again and got clean away. Two
of them are now back in the Navy. The other
died in Turkey when the end of the war was in
sight.</p>

<p>While we were in the church, Kut fell. Some
of us could hardly believe it at first, especially
those who had belonged to the 6th Division. It
seemed too bad to be true. After what we had
heard from those few who had already made the
march from Mesopotamia to railhead, it was plain
that the march of thousands of exhausted men
along those desert ways would be a very terrible
tragedy. But how terrible it was going to be I
don&#8217;t think even the men who had made it quite
realized. The story of that march from Kut is
not for me to write. But the impression that the
arrival of the survivors made upon us earlier
prisoners will be told in its time.</p>

<p>It was a long while yet before they reached
us.</p>

<p>To me personally there came a great piece of
news while we were in the church, for a letter
dated a couple of months back told me that I was
the father of a daughter. The telegram dispatched
upon the same day reached me just three
weeks after the letter. At that time I was
singular in having so close a relation as yet unknown,
but before the end came, as new prisoners
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
dropped in, there were quite a band of us gaolbird
fathers.</p>

<p>Beside the flagged path there were two Armenian
tombs of some pretension, built of marble
and carved with the usual imaginary fauna of
heaven, all heads and wings. Further East, by
the way, these things are flora, and grow on trees.
They were crude affairs, of no interest except to
their owners, but there was a space between them,
and that was of interest to me. For, when the
iron door was first opened in the morning, I used
to come out and hide myself there and write
verses. This is so largely a personal record that
I make no apology for the recurrent references to
my own method of killing care. It meant very
much to me, as each man&#8217;s method did to himself.
In this quiet nook, before the path was
thronged, I wrote a long description in verse of a
Russian concert held in the church and of the
riotous feast that followed it. Far from the riot
I wrote it. But in the church itself, in the very
vortex of hellish sound, I wrote a long poem on
the great forests of Northern Ceylon. Far from
peace, I wrote of the most peaceful place I know.
And this paradox holds good, held good with me
at least, all through. For in the next winter,
with my feet in the Arctic and my head in the
Tropics, with a freezing hand I used to write of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
that sunny land near the Equator. I believe it
kept me warm.</p>

<p>Those hours before the multitude awakened
were great hours. Even the smelly courtyard
was attractive then. For one could look up from
it, right up into the air, and see the great cliff that
towered above the church turn gold in the light of
the early sun. And the cliff was a great place for
birds. Rock pigeons nested there in thousands,
and swallows, and scores of beautiful little kestrels;
and swifts flew, screaming out over the
roofs below. Vultures brought forth their young
there, whose first steps were on five hundred feet
of empty air.</p>

<p>There is a rock in Ceylon very like the Kara-Hissar,
a huge upstanding stump of granite called
Sigiriya, the lion rock, and I had spent many
happy months there, years before, delving into
ruins of fourteen centuries ago. But the Kara-Hissar
was good to look upon, apart from the
memories it awakened, though memories are intensified
in prison. In ordinary life one lives chiefly
for the present: but in prison one lives almost
entirely on the past and for the future.</p>

<p>It was not long before the pear trees came into
blossom, and the white acacia. The sentries had
kept us rigorously to the flagged path at first,
while they used the garden space beneath the pear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
trees to grow a narrow bed of potatoes. But,
either the potatoes failed, or they tired of the
effort, for long before the end of our time there we
used to walk freely to the outer edge, from where
we could look down upon the town below. The
Squire had received a drawing-book and a box of
paints, and he used to make pictures there.</p>

<p>While we were in the church, before the
potatoes had been abandoned, there was quite an
exciting episode connected with an attempt at
escape. The hero was a cheery Irishman, whom
I will call Bart, the owner of one of the dogs, a
beautiful Persian greyhound that he had acquired
in Angora. He made up a bundle of food-stuffs
and concealed it behind one of the Armenian
tombs, where it would be handy when he required
it, and so that he could come out of the church
empty-handed and unsuspicious in appearance.
But one of the guards noticed it, and a special
sentry was put on to keep it under observation.
It was obviously impossible to start like this, and
for the time, at any rate, the attempt had to be
abandoned. But it still remained to recover the
precious pack and its contents. A Turkish
sentry pretending not to watch anything is the
most transparent thing in the world. It was easy
to see what he was at: he wanted to identify the
owner so that he might be cast into a dungeon.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
But it was not so easy to see how he was to be got
rid of while the bag was removed. Bart was prepared
to remove it rapidly inside a folding deck-chair,
but he wanted an opportunity to grab it
unawares. The sacred potatoes gave the key to
the solution. I fetched Gumush, the greyhound,
on a lead, and the perverse creature ran all
over the cherished potatoes. As all the guards
were co-partners in the garden, they all rushed to
prevent the trespass; and the deed was done. In
a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, that pack
was safe in the church and its contents distributed.
The sentry recovered his head, gave one look at
the tomb, and made tracks for the Commandant&#8217;s
office. But we heard of it no more. The trap
had failed, and the bait was gone.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the noise in the church, and
it is only fair to tell of the music, real soul-stirring
music. It was not made by the English; with a
few exceptions they were not a musical lot as far
as performance went. But the Russian sailors
had a choir, and they sang like angels. It must
have made the angels painted on the ceiling
envious to hear them.</p>

<p>Their music was of a kind quite distinct from
Western European music. Very sad and melancholy
as a rule, in a minor key. Generally about
eight of them would sing together, taking parts,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
but sometimes they would all join in, as when
they held a sort of funeral service the night after
their friend had died of typhus. And very few
indeed of them could not sing. It used to put
our own caterwauling concerts to utter shame.
Most of them were simple, rather rough men;
and though we knew them all as Russians in those
pre-revolution days, I believe they really belonged
to half a dozen different tribes; Cossacks, Ukrainians,
Georgians, and Poles. But they could all
sing. They sang the thing they called the Pan-Slav
hymn. It is the forbidden national anthem
of Poland, proscribed, before the war, in Russia,
Austria, and Germany; and with equal fervour
they sang the grand national anthem of Russia.
&#8220;God Save the King&#8221; they sang, too, and made
it sound magnificent. But for the most part they
sang folk-songs. The song we liked the best was
a beautiful Cossack lullaby. A fellow-prisoner
has kindly written it out for me, and it is printed
at the end of this chapter. The words given are
some I wrote for it while in the church.</p>

<p>The singing of the Russians was the best thing
there was in that church.</p>

<p>There were several Indians in Afion at that
time, survivors of the Bagdad consular guard;
and while we were in the church the last, or one of
the last, died. When war broke out there was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
guard of two Indian officers and about four-and-thirty
soldiers attached to the Consulate. They
were interned by the Turks. When disarmed
they had all their kit complete, and they were in
perfect physical condition. They were not half-famished
when captured, like the garrison of Kut.
They were not taken near the fighting line, where
feelings ran high, as the rest of us were; on the
contrary, the fighting line was hundreds of miles
from them. But before the war ended every
single one of those men was dead. They died of
cold, calculated ill-treatment, starvation, and
over-marching.</p>

<p>As I tell this tale, as I thread this rosary of
months and years, there runs throughout a strand
of the blackest tragedy, and it will come out,
do what I can.</p>

<p>I am trying to put in all the funny things that
happened, too, for there are things too sad to be
serious about. But the tragedy is there, and it
must be seen.</p>

<p>Still, it is a bad note to end a chapter on. As
a crowd we were not downhearted, so I will pass
to the tale of the frightened sailor man.</p>

<p>There was a certain sailor man who had heard
strange tales about the Turks on his journeys
round the world. He had heard how they
bastinado men for small faults, and he had probably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
seen it, too; for at the time of which I write
he was a captive in Turkey. In course of time, it
happened that this sailor man, who was not a
highly-educated person, was smitten with disease,
as people in Turkey very often are. And, being
at that time in a city, he was sent to a hospital.
Now he did not know that typhus rages in the
hospitals of the Turks, nor is it probable that he
knew that this disease is conveyed by the bite of
lice. If he had known this he would perhaps have
been even more frightened than he actually was,
and with far better cause. One thing is quite
certain, and that is that he did not know that all
persons admitted to Turkish hospitals are clean-shaved
all over. But he bore in mind many
horrible stories, most of which were true, and,
when a hospital orderly approached him with a
razor in his hand, the sailor man&#8217;s mind was invaded
by the most terrible fear, for he had heard
dreadful tales of the mutilations that Turks were
said to practise upon their enemies. So he cried
aloud with a great voice that it should not be
done. And as for the explanations of the man
with the razor, he heeded them not at all, for he
knew no Turkish. Sooner would he die all at
once, he cried, than be done to death piecemeal.
And his cry was heard, for he prepared to fight,
and the man with the razor did not want to fight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
him, nor did the doctor, nor did the assistant
doctor. So in the end they sent to us for his own
officer, who soothed his troubled mind until he
allowed himself to be shaved.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h4>THE LOWER CAMP</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Towards</span> the latter end of May the great
&#8220;strafe&#8221; ended. The Turks informed us that
our punishment was fulfilled, and that we were to
return to normal times again. For several days
the senior officers of the different nationalities
were very busy examining our new quarters and
arranging matters generally, and then we began
to move by masses out of the church. The
French went first, to an Armenian house in the
town. Soon afterwards the Russians followed
to other houses in the same part of the Armenian
quarter. And then the British officers, of whom
there were now about forty, moved into a completely
new block of jerry-built houses down by
the station road. So new were the houses that
the one I was in had no doors or windows when
we went into it, and was not really completed the
whole time we were there.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
This block of four houses was known as the
Lower Camp, for the Armenian quarter, or
Upper Camp, was on higher ground and about
a mile distant from it.</p>

<p>The Lower Camp consisted of a row of four
houses under one continuous roof. Each house
contained a kitchen and two rooms on the ground
floor, as well as an open space in the centre,
and three bedrooms upstairs, grouped round
a central landing which served as a mess-room.
The orderlies lived downstairs, and
the officers upstairs, two in one small room
at the back, and four in each of the two
larger rooms in front.</p>

<p>Behind the houses was an open space, of rather
over a quarter of an acre in extent, bounded by
the backs of the houses on one side and by walls
on the other three. This was known as the
garden; for, when first we got there, it contained
a couple of dozen cherry-trees about as big as
walking-sticks. But these did not long survive,
for a quarter of an acre is not a large playground
for forty active officers and a dozen equally active
orderlies, to say nothing of dogs and Turkish
guards.</p>

<p>From the upper rooms we had wide views
in both directions, out across the plain and far
away into the distant hills. The front faced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
approximately south-east, and thirty miles away
we could see the fine range of mountains known
as the Sultan Dagh, capped with snow until far on
into the summer. From the back windows we
could see the Kara-Hissar, and a number of other
rocky hills, like islands in the plain; and, in the
distance, rolling hills and mountains one behind
another. A good deal of the plain visible between
the rocks was saline, and in early summer was
blue with masses of a wild flower we knew as sea
lavender.</p>

<p>It was really a beautiful view, especially in the
spring, when the land was not so colourless as at
other times. The soil of the plain was very soft
and friable, and much dust used to hang in suspension,
giving very vivid colours to the sunsets;
sunsets of golden pheasants and peacocks&#8217; tails,
and sunsets of red-hot copper. I have seen every
shadow on the wall in the evening as blue as the
bluest sea.</p>

<p>In the late summer great dust-storms used to
roll up across the plain. We could see them
gather on the distant hills, and come speeding
towards us like banks of fog. And, as we
hurriedly closed all the windows and fixed them
tight, the storms would break upon the rocks,
towering up high into the air in waves of brown,
while the main body drove furiously towards us
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
and lashed at the windows. A high wind would
blow furiously for a few minutes, and then the
storm would pass on across the plain, and rain
would sprinkle the dust.</p>

<p>Some day that plain will be a great natural
aerodrome, where people will halt on their way
from Europe to the Far East.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the house I was in, No. 3,
were practically the same as in the house by the
city wall in Angora. No. 1 was principally
Mesopotamian, No. 2 chiefly the old Afion
crowd, and No. 4 largely composed of the second
Angora house. During the next two and a-half
years many new prisoners came, and the old inhabitants
had periodical times of restlessness
when they shifted round, but the nuclei of the
houses remained more or less constant, and the
characteristic tone of each house remained practically
unalterable. It is a very curious thing this
tone or soul of each small subdivision of a
community. I suppose every home in England
has its own personal tone. Certainly each house
in a public school has. Each ship has, and each
regiment; and, in a larger way, each nation has,
and will retain it despite Bolshevism.</p>

<p>We had not long been in the Lower Camp
when new prisoners began to arrive. I cannot
pretend to remember the order of their coming,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
for I kept no diary and have not a single note to
help me; it does not, in any case, matter.</p>

<p>The yeomanry taken at Katia in the Sinai
peninsula passed through on their way to a town
in the north of Anatolia. We only had a glimpse
of them as they passed; but we were able to
supply them with a few books.</p>

<p>Other prisoners came in who stayed with us.
The earliest to arrive were a very few who had
been taken, one or two at a time, in the attempt
to relieve Kut. One of these had been kept for
several days in a small tent with a number of
Arabs condemned to death. The Arabs were
not allowed out of the tent for any purpose whatever.</p>

<p>Another had been chained to an Indian, and
had dysentery while so chained. He and the
Indian both got typhus, and the Indian died.
After weeks in hospital the Britisher pulled
through typhus, malignant malaria, and chronic
rheumatism. He is now pulling through phthisis.
Before that he had had sunstroke, and he was
shot through the chest; not a bad record for a
constitution to have pulled through.</p>

<p>Another British officer had been housed in the
public gaol at Mosul, among the Turkish
criminals, whose habits were so filthy that he
asked to be allowed a privy to himself. His
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
request was met by an order calculated to
humiliate a clean Englishman in the eyes of the
people of Mosul; for, after that, he was taken
out each day by an armed guard and graciously
permitted to make use of the street in the open
bazaar. As I said before, Turks are a disgusting
people.</p>

<p>Gradually, as more prisoners arrived, we overflowed
into the Upper Camp. The Russians
were sent away to another part of Anatolia, and
their houses given over to British.</p>

<p>One other visit we had, from a German Staff-Colonel
and several subordinates. &#8220;When will
the war end?&#8221; we asked the great man.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we have taken Verdun,&#8221; was his reply.</p>

<p>We had not much liberty at this time. A
certain number of officers were allowed to go
shopping on several days in the week. A piece
of rocky ground was assigned to us to play cricket
on. Each officer was allowed to go to the
Turkish bath once a week. And once a week the
camps visited each other.</p>

<p>For the rest, we had the garden, and the Upper
Camp had a part of the street between their
houses.</p>

<p>The chief game in the garden was a sort of
badminton, played over a net with tennis rackets
and balls made of stitched-up lumps of old sock.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
It went by the name of Bufru, coined by a
cunning forger of Turkish.</p>

<p>But indoors there were many activities, both
mental and physical. I should be afraid to say
how many people wrote books. But the number
of those who wrote plays must have been even
greater. Some of them were very well produced.
Several officers, notably one of the Australians,
showed themselves to be quite expert designers
of costumes, and most efficient needlemen. And
some of the youngsters made very pretty women.
The art of the female sex, in dressing as they do,
was borne in upon me when I saw how quite plain
young men could be made to look most attractive
girls. <b>A</b> for a day, <b>B</b> for a week, and <b>C</b> for a life
partnership, as someone wickedly compared the
attractions of the three leading ladies. Some of
the plays were very funny indeed, but the wit
was not of that order which makes you pride
yourself that you can see it. As a rule, it flew up
and struck you all of a heap.</p>

<p>Another trial of the times was the debating
society, in which all things on earth were discussed
in due form, with a chairman, a proposer and
seconder, an opposer and his second, a butter-in,
and a ribald gallery. For days afterwards I used
to hear the points argued and re-debated by the
orderlies in the kitchen beneath my room. And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
two of the officers took themselves as future
Public Men so seriously that they used to practise
elocution on each other, each in turn suffering
himself to be addressed by the other as
&#8220;Gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were lectures, too, some of them very
good ones. The subjects dealt with were catholic
and included cocoanut-planting, Mendelism,
flying, submarines, Singhalese history, Greek
coins, Egyptian irrigation, and a host of other
matters.</p>

<p>Besides these public efforts, there were men
studying all manner of things in little cliques, or
by themselves. One officer who knew no Arabic
tapped Zaki to such good purpose that he (not
Zaki) wrote an Arabic grammar. One old
Australian of fifty, who had always
lived, and would continue to live, in the
back of beyond, studied simultaneously
French, Norwegian, and Esperanto. There
were teachers of mathematics, teachers of
German, Tamil, Italian, Turkish and Russian.
There were people teaching themselves to draw,
or to play musical instruments. There were
people studying law and medicine. I am sure
that, at that time, we were the greatest centre
of intellectual endeavour in the whole of the
Turkish Empire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
In addition to the more purely intellectual
occupations there were a number of really skilled
carpenters, an officer who made himself an excellent
little forge, where he turned out some very
clever work, after having first manufactured the
needful tools out of scrap steel; among them I
remember a pocket-knife with various implements
in it, and a stethoscope. The latter was
for Bill.</p>

<p>Then there were cunning adorners of rooms,
and still more cunning mixers of cocktails, in
which a number of nauseous ingredients was
made to taste good, as two negatives make an
affirmative.</p>

<p>There were also breeders of dogs. Quite a rage
there was for keeping dogs, on a quarter of an
acre of land. Hilda and Gumush, the two
original hounds of the Church days, presented
their owners respectively with twelve and eleven
puppies all in one week. At first it was very
pretty to watch Bart training the young greyhounds,
and teaching them to jump; he was a
notable trainer of dogs. But when they all
grew up, the overcrowding became intolerable.
Public opinion revolted. Feelings were very
deeply stirred, and people voted anti-dog or pro-dog,
or pro-two-dogs, or pro or anti every
possible combination and permutation of dogs.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
In the end the dogs were treated much as
the Armenians. Some were slain, more
were deported, and only three remained:
Hilda, Gumush, and a funny little animal
called Roger, who had a long body on the
smallest legs, with the lowest gear, that I have
ever seen.</p>

<p>In addition to dogs there were other pets:
ducks, pigeons, chickens, enormous eagle-owls,
a vulture, magpies, and finally a wolf. Cats
were tried, but were somehow not a success.</p>

<p>There was also the native fauna. In my room I
caught mice, voles, and shrews. Also smaller and
more unpleasant creatures. Quite a feature of the
spring awakening was the almost universal &#8220;bug-strafing&#8221;
of beds. Our beds were all home made:
a frame of pinewood, strung with thin rope, and
carried on four legs. The joints and the holes
where the rope passed through were the chief
haunts of the foe. After breakfast, on a warm
morning, officers in shirt sleeves, with kettles of
boiling water and pots of Stockholm tar, might be
seen carrying out that bold military measure
known as a bug-strafe.</p>

<p>In summer I slung my bed by four ropes from
the ceiling, and was fairly immune. They did
not climb down the ropes, and they could not
reach up from the floor, even standing on tip-toe.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
It was not only secure, but uncommonly comfortable.</p>

<p>Occasionally the Turks searched through our
belongings to see if we had disguises, or diaries,
or food stored for escape.</p>

<p>The first time they did it they caught us
properly; but made an awful muddle of their
triumph.</p>

<p>We were all ordered out into the garden, for
what purpose we did not know; and, once out,
sentries were placed at all the doors, and we were
not allowed back again. But we asked as a favour
that one cook in each house might be permitted
to return, as otherwise our dinners would be
spoiled. This was allowed. They began by
searching No. 1 house, and as they were doing so
our noble cook hid everything of any importance
that he could lay hands on. Some under the
charcoal, and some under the straw in Roger&#8217;s
kennel. Roger was very snappy with Turks, like
all good dogs he detested them; and he sat tight
on all my MSS. among other things. Everything
in writing that a Turk cannot understand
is to him abominable. What he can understand
is rare above rubies.</p>

<p>Despite the efforts of the cooks, they did find
a great deal of written matter, some of which it
had been very unwise to keep: such things as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
diaries with descriptions of acts of atrocity in
them, and plans for escape. There was nothing,
so far as I ever heard, of the slightest military
value. But there was a great deal that might
have done us much harm. Perhaps the church
over again. Fortunately the whole mass of
literature was so enormous that it could not
possibly be dealt with on the spot, so everything,
plays, books, mess accounts, and the notes of
study, as well as the more dangerous things, was
stuffed into two or three sacks, and put in a small
house in the garden. In addition to the sentry
permanently in the garden, another, with a
loaded rifle, was placed to guard the small house.
This consisted of one room, with a barred window
at one end, and a barred window and a locked
door at the side. The side opposite to the door
was blank, and was part of the garden wall. But
the end facing No. 4 house had a tiny window
in it which had no bars. There were no blinds
to any of the windows, and the sentry had only
to look in to see that the sacks were still there.</p>

<p>The matter was very serious indeed. There
was some very incriminating stuff there, and we
did not at all desire another two months of the
church. All sorts of measures were proposed and
rejected. Burning the whole place down was
mooted, but decided to be impossible, for paper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
burns so slowly that the sacks would certainly be
saved. Then Bart did a very daring thing. He
had slim shoulders, but a great heart, and he
thought his narrow body might squeeze through
the unbarred window. He waited an opportunity
and dived through. Once in, squatted on
the floor, the sentry would have to come right up
to the window in order to see him. But the
sentry only watched the door. And while he
watched, Bart went through the lot as swiftly as
a post office sorter, and removed more than
half of the most dangerous items. He got
safely out again, while the sentry still watched
the door.</p>

<p>In No. 3 house, an officer named Budd was less
fortunate. Trying to explain that he wanted to
keep the mess accounts, he lost his temper and
damned the interpreter. He was at once
searched personally, and sent away into the town,
where he was confined in a cellar. When he
asked for bread, the gaoler said, &#8220;Para yok,
ekmek yok,&#8221; which means, &#8220;No money, no
bread.&#8221; Fortunately, Budd had money; but he
had a very unpleasant five or six days before he
was released. In the cell next to his he heard
a poor, miserable little Chaldean priest, who had
bravely but unwisely kept some record of the
Armenian girls enslaved in various Turkish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
families, being mercilessly flogged, and screaming
in his agony.</p>

<p>Bart had collected some of the diaries, but
there were still others, and at least one plan of
escape most unwisely committed to writing. A
community would be incomplete without its salt
of folly.</p>

<p>A few days later the remaining documents returned
to us too. The Turks had bungled over
the cooks, bungled over guarding their spoil, and
now they bungled again worse than ever. They
had a positive genius for incompetency: a
masterly faculty for determining the wrong way
to do a thing, and for doing it. After a few
days, a sack of papers and note-books was returned
to the camp. To our surprise, it was
found to contain all those documents which
we had feared the Turks might discover
and keep.</p>

<p>But the puzzle was elucidated by a letter which
followed, a rather abject letter from the interpreter,
stating that he had returned the wrong
sack by mistake, and, if we would not tell the
Commandant of his error, would now send us the
right one! So we recovered everything.</p>

<p>In the Upper Camp they were not so lucky.
There, the Turks adopted the simple method of
destroying all written matter. It was things like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
that which made it so difficult for officers
to keep any account of the treatment of their
men.</p>

<p>The only person, besides Budd, who suffered
actual penalty from this raid, so far as I remember,
was the celebrated French cook, late of the
Jockey Club. He had kept a diary, and in it
had stupidly written the use to which he thought
the Turkish flag should be put by a French sailor.
It might be thought, after some of our treatment,
that this was merely tit-for-tat, six of one and
half a dozen of the other. As a fact, it was
twelve dozen of one and very gross of the other.
So the French cook went to gaol, and we saw him
in Afion no more.</p>

<p>In this gallery of portraits I think Porter is
more than worthy of mention. He was an
orderly in No. 4 house, a slight, fair-haired young
fellow from the Isle of Wight. Before the war
he had been a barber, and he used to cut our
hair and trim our beards: for many of us grew
beards. But his claim to fame was that he was
the most wounded man in Afion. In an attack
on Gallipoli he had been shot through the body,
and while lying on the ground had been terribly
wounded again by shrapnel. To finish him off
the Turks had cut his head open with a shovel,
and bayoneted him many times. He had in all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
twenty-one wounds. But he resolutely refused
to die, and when last I saw him was as merry as
a cricket, and able to play quite a good game of
football. I sometimes wonder how many wound-stripes
he is entitled to, and whether he is trying
to grow fat enough to wear them all. He told
me once that what he disliked most was being
stabbed in the stomach; and he certainly is an
authority to be respected.</p>

<p>Having no diary, I shall certainly not tempt
critics by trying to fix a date for the total eclipse
of the moon. But one occurred while I was in
the lower camp, some time between June of 1916
and November of 1917. It was either just before
or just after the entry of Greece into the war.
Elston and I, who occupied a small room at the
back of the house, had gone to bed early and
were nearly asleep when we were roused by repeated
firing away in the town. We sat at the
window and watched flash after flash; some in the
streets, some on the hill-side, and some
apparently from the windows. There were the
shots of modern rifles, of revolvers, and the
duller boom of old-fashioned muzzle-loading
guns. We thought at first it was brigands
attacking the town. Then we remembered the
Greeks, and we feared that a great massacre had
begun, for there were many Greeks in Afion.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
They must be putting up a good fight, we
thought, as we listened to the continuous crackling,
and watched the flashes. So we went across
the mess-room to see if the others in the front
rooms, had heard it, too. We found them all
gathered at the windows, watching the eclipse of
the moon. The whole town was blazing away
at the dragon who was swallowing the moon. In
the road before the house our sentries stood
anxiously, all blazing away Government ammunition
in the good cause; ammunition that was
meant for us. They just flung their rifles to their
shoulders and opened rapid fire, loaded up, and
did it again.</p>

<p>In No. 2 house there was an officer who had
lived for years in Turkey and knew the language
well; so, when the N.C.O. in charge of the guard
addressed his troops, we had a ready interpreter.
&#8220;We are all ignorant men,&#8221; said the chaous.
&#8220;I am ignorant myself. But I know that the
moon has not gone for ever. It will return.
Still, I don&#8217;t like that blood-red colour, so fire
away.&#8221; And they did.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h4>THE SECOND YEAR</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> a large extent, the events chronicled in the
last chapter overlap into the second year. Some
have been recorded as the natural sequels to
others, and some generalisations cover the whole
of captivity. But, broadly speaking, I am trying
to make the record as continuous as possible, and
to preserve chronological order.</p>

<p>We had been in Turkey for less than a year
when we first established code correspondence
with England. All our letters were censored in
Vienna as well as in Constantinople, and perhaps
locally; but, so far as we know, our code was never
discovered. It was suspected, at least, some
means of communication was suspected, because
the Turkish Government was requested, through
the Dutch Embassy, to set right certain urgent
wrongs, and they knew that some one of us
must have reported those wrongs. Letters
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
frequently used to arrive with the marks of
a hot iron on them, showing that they had
been tested for at least one form of invisible
writing. There are many forms of
invisible writing, but we did not use them. We
used a plain, straightforward code, and our
letters might have been read by anyone on earth.
It was curious that none of us should have arranged
a code before leaving home, but no one
had, and I never yet met a prisoner who had even
contemplated the idea of being captured.</p>

<p>Since our correspondence, after passing
through several hands and various different addresses
in England, eventually reached the War
Office, it is obviously impossible for me to
describe it. But I should like, however anonymously,
to pay a tribute to the clever person who
received the first code letter, realized that it was
code, discovered the key to it, knew what to do
with it, and acted as our central post office for
the two and a-half years. He (she) had no idea
that a code message was coming, and had no clue
beyond what his (her) brain afforded.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure, too, to be able to claim that,
though immobilized, we were not altogether
useless.</p>

<p>What exactly they would have done with us if
they had brought home to us a charge of conveying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
information of military value, I do not know.
The most probable fate would have been a
dungeon until the end of the war, or for as long as
one could stand it. But, though I am unable to
make further reference to the system we actually
used, it may not be completely without interest to
give an example of what can be done in the
simplest possible way. For instance, a prisoner
writes the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Elijah</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is four months now since you wrote to me about the proposed
division of Dad&#8217;s property, and I have not had a single line since.
If I am passed over because I am away it will be very hard,
through no fault of my own. I don&#8217;t think that Gwendoline
will be greedy enough to treat me as you say. And anyhow I
rely upon you to do your best to bag the old hall clock for me.
Dear old Dad always meant it for me, and it seems only
yesterday that he promised me it, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>That is simple enough. It would pass any
censor. But it contains military information.
It is not the code we used, but it was, as a matter
of fact, one which was held in reserve as a possibly
useful one. It was never communicated home.</p>

<p>Read it again in the light of the key,
which is the Greek letter &#960;. Every schoolboy
knows &#960;. It is something or other to
do with the relation of a circle&#8217;s circumference to
its diameter. I am no mathematician, but I
know that &#960; means 3&middot;14159. Take the third word
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
of the first line, the first of the second line, the
fourth of the third line, and so on right through
the letter following &#960;. It will then read: &#8220;Four
division passed through to Bag Dad yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition to writing codes, I took to studying
cypher, and of all the nine or ten varieties of
cypher given me by various prisoners never found
one for which a method of solution could not be
worked out. An average piece of Playfair took
me about three and a-half hours: probably an
expert would do it in half that time. This is not
written as an advertisement for the study of
cypher, but to show the straits to which a prisoner
may be driven for want of occupation. Few
occupations are more detestable than poring over
cypher, but total inaction is worse. It is an
occupation for a slave, and now I am no longer a
slave I hope never to do it again.</p>

<p>Enough has been said of prisoners&#8217; occupations
now for the rest to be left to imagination. Here
endeth the Arts and Crafts section.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the summer of 1916 some of
the generals taken in Kut passed through Afion.
None of them made more than one night&#8217;s stop
there. But after them there came some officers
who did stop; and from them we heard how the
men had suffered on their deadly trek over the
desert. The road from Bagdad to Aleppo is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
strewn with the bones of the British and Indian
soldiers of Kut. We used to see gangs of men
arrive and walk up from the station to the town,
almost too weak to look up at our windows as
they passed. And hundreds, thousands, have
died or been killed on the way, long before they
reached Afion. At Afion itself they were not
badly treated then, but they reached that comparative
refuge so weak and worn out that very
many of them died there. We used to see their
bodies by twos and threes and half-dozens being
carried to the Armenian cemetery where they
were buried. We were not allowed to go to their
funerals, but later, when we had a padre, he was
allowed to read the burial service over the
Christians.</p>

<p>The senior British officer was allowed a little,
a very little, communication with the men. The
other officers were allowed none at all. But
through our shopping orderlies we kept in touch
with them. Those shopping orderlies became
masters of intrigue. I am sure that each successive
senior officer did every single thing that
he could for the men. It was uphill work the
whole way through. The unfortunate officer
who had to deal direct with the Turkish officials
found himself baffled at every point by lies, and
lies, and lies; by cheating and by bare-faced robbery.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Whatever he could do he did do, but it
was absolutely heart-breaking. Thank goodness,
I was a very junior officer, and one who trembled
in the presence of more than three stars.</p>

<p>I have been to that cemetery, not so very bad
a place as cemeteries go. There is a stone wall
round it, and in it are a number of Armenian
tombstones of white marble. Many of them
have carved upon them little pictures of the implements
proper to the deceased&#8217;s trade: scissors for
a tailor, a hammer and a chisel for a stonemason,
and so forth. A very large number bear the
image of a small basin with a very fat caterpillar
in it. I thought it was the worm which dieth
not, but others have held it to be a chalice containing
the spirit of the departed rising in vapour.</p>

<p>It was a sad place, and many good fellows lie
there, both officers and men, who need not have
died.</p>

<p>Afion was looked upon by the Turks as a rest
camp. The church and the Medrisseh were used
as barracks for the sick and for worn-out prisoners.
But when the men gained strength again they
were sent out in working parties: some to cut
timber in the forests near the Black Sea, some to
work on the railway then being built through the
Taurus mountains, and some even beyond the
Taurus. There were good places and there were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
bad; and in the worst of them life was Hell, and
death came swiftly.</p>

<p>The only prisoner we ever had who had been a
prisoner in Germany too during this war&mdash;he had
escaped from there and been recaptured&mdash;said that
the difference in treatment between the worst
places in Germany and Turkey was this: in Germany
the men were ill-treated until they became
ill, and were then put into hospital; in Turkey
they were ill-treated until they became ill, and
were then ill-treated more until they died. Before
the end we used to reckon, so far as we could get
smuggled figures, that seventy-five per cent. of all
men who had been taken prisoners two years or
more earlier were dead. Three out of every four.
It was not only the Kut prisoners who had gone
on short rations before they were captured. It
was all the prisoners, all those who were not
officers. For the Turks thought that if they sent
back to England most of the officers, no inquiry
would be made about the men by the British
nation, any more than, in the opposite case, the
Sublime Porte would have seriously objected. I
have met people who thought it was only the Kut
prisoners who were ill-treated, but, once that
tragic march across the desert was over, the prisoners
from Kut, officers and men alike, mixed
with the other prisoners from all the other fronts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
and were in no way distinguished from them,
either by the Turks or by themselves.</p>

<p>There were places where working parties were
treated well. We heard the most extraordinary
tales of places where British N.C.O.&#8217;s were running
the whole show themselves, running the
prisoners and running the Turks too: men who
had come to the top by sheer force of character.
It is very greatly to be hoped that some account
of this will see daylight. I wish the details were
in my hands. But these places were rare. There
were other hells upon earth where the men were
beaten and starved, robbed of the money sent
them from home, robbed of their parcels, frozen
in the winter and overdriven in the summer
until they died, either from sheer collapse or
from one of the many diseases that a dirty
country breeds.</p>

<p>People who have no special knowledge of
Turkey-in-Asia hardly realize what the winter is
like there. The last winter we were in Afion snow
fell at the end of November and did not melt
until the middle of March. The temperature
ranged round about zero for a good many weeks.
What this meant to the men in some of the bad
places can easily be imagined. Clothes were
provided for them by our Government, acting
through the Protecting Embassy; but, except
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
where British officers were stationed and were permitted
to issue them, these clothes were nearly
always stolen. So were their boots. One of the
orderlies in the house I was in latterly had twice
been to hospital&mdash;before he became an orderly&mdash;and
each time he had been looted of every stitch
he possessed and of his boots. Both times he had
to start again in Turkish rags.</p>

<p>It is not my aim to complain about the lot of
the officers. We were lucky to be alive, and we
did not really have a very bad time. But most of
the men were so unlucky that they are now dead,
and while they lived they suffered all manner
of ill.</p>

<p>This book would indeed be incomplete were I
to fail to tell of the plight of the men.</p>

<p>I expect they are forgetting it. People do
forget things.</p>

<p>But I must go back to our own history, the
history of the Lower Camp in 1916-17.</p>

<p>That winter was a mild one. We played football
about two or three times a week on a small
ground about half a mile from the camp.
Association was the rule that year, but the
following winter we played Rugby. The football
ground was a long, rather narrow strip between
two ploughed fields, and the reasons it was not
ploughed up were two. It sloped toward the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
road, and all the lower portion was used as
a threshing floor at harvest time. The Turkish
method of threshing is a very remarkable one,
very early, I imagine. When the straw stacks
have ripened sufficiently they are broken up, and
large circular mats of straw with the grain in it
are arranged upon the ground. On these mats
sleds made of three planks, and, drawn by horses,
are driven round and round, as though in a circus.
Under the sleds are grooves containing rows of
sharp flints which cut all the straw up into chaff
and separate the grain from the husk. Then the
whole mass is winnowed in the wind, and divided
into two heaps, one of food for man and the other
of food for beasts. Which of the two our bread
was made of I forget.</p>

<p>This threshing naturally requires a good deal
of space, and it protected the lower part of our
football field. The upper half was conserved in
quite a different way, for it was a Hebrew
cemetery.</p>

<p>There was a large slab or soft rock in it, roughly
squared and conveniently situated for those who
wished to watch the game.</p>

<p>Three of us were sitting on this one day when
a Turk, driving a cart along the road, turned his
horse and drove up to this stone. He asked us to
move to one side, and then gravely led the horse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
three times round the stone, after which he dug
out a piece of earth from under the stone and gave
it to the horse to eat. The only thing we could
get out of him was that the horse was ill and that
it would now get well. To prove his point he
beat it all the way back to the road and made it
canter. There was only one thing remarkable
about the stone, and that was that it was pierced
all over by nails hammered in, nails of all shapes
and sizes, and some of them entirely rusted away,
leaving only a stained hole. But just think of
the plight of that poor horse! Officially
speaking, it was now well, registered as A1.
Any further weariness would be put down to
malingering, and treated accordingly.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1917 we began to get a little
more liberty. For some time the Commandant
answered all applications to be allowed to go out
for walks by saying that the weather was not yet
fine enough, a subterfuge so transparent that I
suspect he was laughing at us. His sense of
humour was a very grim one. He appeared one
morning and told the senior officer that three
British soldiers were to be hanged that day. Of
course there was a vigorous protest made; but,
after a while, the Commandant smiled and went
away. He then visited the senior French officer
and told him that three Frenchmen were to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
hanged. After he had enjoyed his joke
sufficiently, it came out that three Turks
actually were hanged on that day. There
was nobody to protest for them, poor devils!
The Turkish method of hanging is to erect
a tripod, rather like a strong, high camera-stand.
The victim stands below the centre
of this, a noose is passed round his neck,
and the legs of the tripod are pushed closer and
closer in until the man is lifted from the ground
and strangled. The men at the Medrisseh often
saw public execution take place, I believe.</p>

<p>But when spring grew fine enough we actually
did go for several long walks, and saw the little
yellow crocuses thrusting their heads up on the
hill-sides. It was good to see flowers grow again.
The wild flowers were wonderful round Afion.
But that spring we saw little of them. The
policy was changed again, and instead of being
allowed out for walks in the country, we were
allotted a little corner of one of the hills overlooking
the town. Here we used to march, twice
a week, and sit for an hour or two on the grass.
It was steep and rocky, and there was nothing else
to be done there. People used to take books out
there, or pencils and paper and try to draw the one
view. Then we would walk back to tea, through
the slums of Afion, down narrow roads, past huts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
and graveyards, past kitchen middens where dead
cats&#8217; and horses&#8217; skulls lay, and where children
played: sturdy, grimy little urchins who used to
abuse us, and make their favourite cutthroat
sign, drawing their baby hands across their
necks.</p>

<p>I forget when the policy was changed again.
It was always being changed. Capricious and
wavering as thistledown. But in the summer we
had quite a lot of liberty. We used to gather
huge armfuls of purple larkspur, pink orchis, and
yellow dog-roses. It was a good time for most
of us, but early in the summer five officers were
suddenly taken from their friends and shut up in
a separate house in the Armenian quarter. They
were allowed a short time twice daily for exercise
in about 50 yards of the street, but for the rest
were no better off than if they were in gaol.
They were not released until about Christmas
time. All this was because the Commandant
suspected them of planning to escape.</p>

<p>The Upper Camp grew a great deal larger that
year. All the Russians came back again, and
with them a great many more Russian officers
who had been interned at Sivas for several years
previously. From Yozgat, too, a large number
of British officers came, among whom were two
of the three who had escaped in March, 1916.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
From being a camp of one British house and one
French, the Upper Camp now spread the whole
length of one street, and into two neighbouring
by-streets. The whole community of prisoners
in that camp lived in Armenian houses.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that the camps as a
whole lost interest a great deal after this. They
certainly became more respectable, but the
character of the place altered. It improved on the
whole, but it was duller. In the old days we had
at least this in common, that we were all
different; we had all come into Turkey in
different ways and at different times. Now that
queer distinction disappeared, for most of the
new-comers were from Kut, the senior officers
in nearly all of the houses were from Kut, and
Kut rather dominated the conversation. We
old-timers were a little sick of Kut. They were
mostly old regular soldiers, and senior to the rest
of us. Let me hasten to say that I have never
met a nicer lot of men. That was part of the
difficulty. They were nicer than we were. But
they had all led the same sort of lives before the
war, and during the war. They had all fought in
the same battles, and been in the same siege.
They had all the same adventure to tell. I have
great friends among them, and I hope they will
smile if ever they read this. But the old-timers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
will smile, too, and recognize the truth that is
in me.</p>

<p>One result of this influx was that we all became
very unsettled. The fact was that we had stagnated
too long, and were growing very queer.
We were used to new prisoners dropping in one
or two at a time, and trying to teach us how to be
prisoners. We knew how to be prisoners; we
had learned it in a bitter school; so we smiled at
these new babes in the wood, let them kick against
the pricks a little, and took them to our bosoms.
They made no difference. But you can&#8217;t take
old regular lieutenant-colonels to your bosom,
you have to wait until they take you to theirs.
They do in time, at least these did. But they
unsettled the whole place, and it was probably
very good for us.</p>

<p>The result was a break up of many happy
homes, a great deal of arrangement and rearrangement
of houses, and when we settled
down again it was like a new Parliament with a
different cleavage of parties, and a strange
Government.</p>

<p>At the end of all this I found myself in the
Upper Camp, in a house of twelve almost
equally divided between Kut and non-Kut. It
was a very happy house. I don&#8217;t think anyone
in it really hated any of the others; and, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
prison, that means that you like each other very
much, and will always be glad to meet each other
again for the rest of your lives.</p>

<p>It was a very respectable house. Much too
respectable to be popular. Indeed it was a byword
for respectability, until Good Friday, 1918;
but that is anticipating.</p>

<p>We thought, a lot of us, that the war was going
to end that year, so who can say that we were
downhearted?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<h4>THE LAST YEAR IN AFION</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> accurate description of all our ups and
downs, of liberty enlarged and liberty snatched
away again, and of all the fluctuating fortunes
of the camp would be as dull as our lives were,
and as little likely to be voluntarily undergone
as was our captivity. That gem of time cannot
be polished in all its facets, lest the observer
should be dazzled. All that will be attempted
here is some account of the main events.
Another man, looking at that time from a
different angle, might write a book that would
hardly parallel this upon a single point, and yet
be as true a picture.</p>

<p>We were all growing very weary indeed of
being prisoners. Prices had continued their
inexorable rise, and frequent mass meetings were
held to discuss ways and means, for of course
there were poor among us who could not afford
to get money sent from home, and the pace of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
the convoy had to be that of the slowest ship.
The only alternative would have been to break
up into houses where men lived by bread alone,
and houses where plutocrats resided who were
able to import money at the disastrous rates
obtainable. For it cost a very large sum to
import money. A cheque on an English bank
for &pound;20 would produce a draft of &pound;Tq.26. This
would be paid in paper, and to find its true
value must be divided by six; so by spending
&pound;20 a prisoner could obtain the value of
&pound;4 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Of course we did import money, whatever it
cost, even the poorest of us practically had to,
unless he would freeze in the winter. The
actual necessaries of life, food, fuel, and clothes
of sorts, were always obtainable in Turkey; at
a price. The country was so completely unorganized,
and the railway so congested that
food-stuffs might be plentiful in one district and
almost unobtainable in another not far away.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
But where the food was grown it was always
obtainable, and fortunately for us, Afion was
in an agricultural district.</p>

<p>The winter of 1917-18 was a very severe one.
Late in November the street that was our only
playground and space for exercise was filled with
snow. It ran east and west, overhung by a
steep hill on the south, and deprived of sun by
the opposite row of houses. No sunlight at all
reached that street for quite three months, and
during the whole of that time it was paved with
snow that had been trodden hard.</p>

<p>There were refugees in the town that winter,
people of strange appearance to us who were
used to the Turks. They were said to be Kurds
mostly, but there were certainly several tribes
represented. For some reason or other they had
been evacuated from some part of the Turkish
Empire further east, and dumped down at Afion.
Their clothes were those of a warm climate,
and many of the little children had but one thin
garment apiece. Nominally, I expect, they were
supposed to be fed by their predatory Government:
actually they were on or over the verge
of starvation. We used to see them from our
windows, and on our comparatively rare passages
through the town.</p>

<p>There is no sanitation in a Turkish town.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
All refuse is cast upon middens, which in the
course of ages become great mounds. Houses
do not last long in Turkey; they are but flimsily
built and fires are very frequent. They decay
or are destroyed by fire, and they are rebuilt
upon these middens. I picked up a Roman
coin once where a midden had been disturbed,
for they are very old.</p>

<p>And one of the uses of these middens is to
provide food for the utterly poor. These poor
refugees used to haunt those hideous piles of
decaying matter and pick food from them. Dogs
and donkeys, children and buffalo calves, old
women and cats, used to scramble and scrape for
the last pieces.</p>

<p>We had a Rugby football that winter, and
in a field by the river, another of the wide
threshing floors, we began to play when the
snow melted. There were some very good
players, and we had one new prisoner who held,
and I believe still holds, the &#8217;Varsity record for
both the 100 yards and the quarter-mile. There
were several matches, and one very great
triumph, when The Dardanelles played The
World and beat it. There were so few to pick
from that I played for the Dardanelles. Until
that winter, the last game I had played was in
Ceylon in 1902; and I went to bed for three days
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
after the match. But we, the old-timers, beat
the World and rejoiced exceedingly.</p>

<p>One other thing that happened that winter
must be told, though it is painful to write it.
There was a Russian named Constantine B.,
who had become estranged from the other
Russians for a fault of his own. He was afterwards
forgiven, and taken back, so it would not
become me to say anything about it. For the
time, however, he lived separately in a small house
with a Russian anarchist and a Russo-Armenian
thief, and the three of them were outlaws.
Also they hated each other, and used to quarrel.
One of their quarrels became acute enough to
attract the attention of the Turkish Commandant,
the infamous Masl&ucirc;m Bey, who visited
their house to make inquiries, and there lost his
temper and struck Constantine B. Constantine
was not really a bad fellow. He had done
one bad thing, but he was out of place in that
house. He was a man of about thirty,
tall, well built, with very fair hair. A
brave man, and quick-tempered. He put
up his arm to protect himself, and he was
lost. The Commandant accused him of trying to
reach for his, the Turk&#8217;s, sword, and had him
arrested.</p>

<p>Constantine B. was taken away from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
officers&#8217; camp to the church where were some
British soldiers; in the little courtyard where
we used to box he was stripped and tied head
downwards with his feet in the air. The Commandant
stood by while Constantine was beaten
upon the soles of the feet with raw hide whips
until he fainted. An hour later he was beaten
again until he lost consciousness once more.
As they grew tired the Commandant called new
hands to beat him; every Turk there had a turn
at beating him. And, when he could feel no
more, Masl&ucirc;m Bey kicked and struck him all
over, everywhere on his body, and spat upon him.
Then he was taken into a dungeon and thrown
upon a heap of quicklime where his face got
burnt.</p>

<p>Masl&ucirc;m&#8217;s cup was not yet full. Constantine
recovered in time, though he is lame. Masl&ucirc;m
went on to his worst offence. He had flogged
our men and the Russians. He had imprisoned
British officers in filthy holes, for little
or no cause. He had lied, and swindled, and
stolen, and grown rich. He now proceeded to
overstep even the line which a Turkish officer
draws. All through the writing of this book
there has loomed ahead of me the grave difficulty
of dealing with Masl&ucirc;m Bey&#8217;s greatest offence.
It ought to be recorded, but I loathe doing it.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Let those who can read between the lines.
Some of the British soldiers were very young,
fair-haired Saxon boys from Wessex. They
had seen a vast deal of cruelty, and they knew
how easy it was for Masl&ucirc;m Bey to flog them,
even to kill them, or to send them to places
where they would almost certainly die. Four of
these became the victims of the abominable
wickedness of Masl&ucirc;m. Under the shadow of
a raw hide whip, in the hands of Turkish non-commissioned
officers, they were his victims.</p>

<p>All these offences of Masl&ucirc;m Bey, from the
tragedy of Constantine downwards, were duly
reported to England by code. The very names
of the offences were squeezed into that code.
I had the pleasure of sending the messages myself,
and the framing of them. They got home
safely, and our Government acted at once.</p>

<p>In the end we got rid of Masl&ucirc;m Bey. He
was court-martialled by a commission of utterly
corrupt Turkish officers. The British soldiers
bravely told their stories. I say bravely, for
their lives hung by a hair. A British officer who
knew Turkish equally bravely conducted the
prosecution for our side; and his life hung by a
hair too. But we got rid of Masl&ucirc;m Bey. He
was given five and a-half months&#8217; simple imprisonment.
Not six months, for that would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
have involved loss of rank. His judges did not
think he had deserved to lose rank.</p>

<p>That is why I watch the papers to see if
Masl&ucirc;m Bey has been hanged.</p>

<p>We used to stick up for ourselves in Turkey.
At one time I knew how many commandants of
prison camps were broken by the British in three
and a-half years. But my memory is a prison-memory.
It is like fishing in a well-stocked
stream with a torn landing-net. When you
have got a fish, there you see him plain enough;
but more often you see but a gleam, and he is
gone. The first Commandant of Afion was
broken for swindling; the second broke himself
by letting prisoners escape; the third was
Masl&ucirc;m Bey; and the fourth was a gentleman.
British prisoners broke one Commandant at
Kastamouni, and I believe another at Broussa,
Russians broke one at Kutahia. And down the
line, in the Taurus or beyond it, where there
were no British officers, I believe our men broke
more than one.</p>

<p>After Masl&ucirc;m had gone we were very well
treated. I don&#8217;t think that any prisoners could
have expected to have a juster man to deal with
than our new Commandant, Zeir Bey. Just
think what an opportunity of regeneration
Turkey lost in this war. Had the Ottoman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Government selected men like Zeir Bey to
command each camp, they would have made
friends for themselves not only all over the
British Empire, but in France and her colonies,
in Russia, in Italy and in Rumania. Instead of
which they have made bitter enemies.</p>

<p>Our Indians had the greatest contempt and
hatred for the Turks, all but a few who were
traitors. There were some, a few, real traitors
among the Indians; but there were many more
who are much more to be pitied than blamed for
some of the things they did. Their position was
an exceedingly difficult one. Very many of
them died, thousands of them; but the Turks
were always trying to seduce them from their
allegiance. There was even a paper printed in
Hindustani by the Germans and given free to
the Indians. The Sultan sent for Indian
Mohammedan officers and gave them swords.
One sturdy Pathan, Kutab Gul, went to prison
rather than accept a sword. For the most part
the Indians were kept at different stations from
the British, at Konia and other places where they
could get no guidance from their British officers,
where no one knew their tongue, and where they
could get no news of the war except such as was
faked, and the usual bazaar rumours. And this
went on for years. As they would themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
admit, Indian officers are in some respects very
child-like people. They believe a lot of what
they hear. We had our own means of communication
outside, and we knew how to read between
the lines of German <i>communiqu&eacute;s</i>. Also we
could read French, and in Turkey there are many
papers printed in French for the polyglot peoples
of the Eastern Mediterranean. But the Indians
had none of these means. For instance, if we
read &#8220;The enemy attacked near Braye and was
heavily defeated. By their self-abnegation our
brave umteenth regiment of Bavarians threw the
enemy back with bloody losses,&#8221; we knew what
it meant. It was the obituary notice of the
umteenth Bavarians, who had been wiped out.
If the <i>communiqu&eacute;</i> went on to say, &#8220;Our line,
according to a pre-arranged plan, now stretches
from X to Y,&#8221; we knew just how far the
Germans had retreated. If our maps did not
show the places, someone among the officers,
either British or French, generally knew them.
But how were the Indians to know that? They
learned Turkish and read the Turkish papers,
but that was no good. The Turkish method
of camouflaging news is not the same as the
German. It is better. They just say nothing.
They never admitted the fall of Bagdad. They
just kept on saying nothing. So skilled were we in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
interpreting the German news that I really
believe we knew just as much about the war as
the average officer outside. Our naval officers
reconstructed the Battle of Jutland, boomed as
a great German victory, so accurately that the
real account we got at last seemed stale
news. We certainly knew more about the war
than the Turkish officers did locally; and they
used to come and look at our great war maps
drawn out on a large scale by Capt. Sandes,
R.E., from innumerable scraps and pieces out
of newspapers.</p>

<p>Sandes did three things. He wrote a book
upon the Mesopotamian campaign, now with a
publisher. He made maps, and he was the
bandmaster. Among the later prisoners there
were a number of musicians, and at least one
really ambitious composer who wrote many
songs and an oratorio. There were three violins
and a guitar in the orchestra, and there used to
be excellent Sunday concerts in the Yozgat
house at the top of the street, which was our
Albert Hall. There were also several prisoners
who sang really well. This last year saw a
great renaissance in the theatrical world too.
There was a revolt against the bondage of the
old border-line jokes, and an attempt to substitute
wit for wickedness. The men in the church
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
used to get up plays, too. Masl&ucirc;m Bey was a
great patron of the theatre, and would save the
best actors from being sent away on working
parties. He used to bring parties of veiled
Turkish women to watch their plays from the
gallery. Behind the altar were dark passages on
either side, built in the thickness of the wall, and
well adapted for the wings of the stage. What
he liked best were love scenes, and he used to send
down messages in the middle of the acting commanding
the performers to make love more
briskly.</p>

<p>With the passing of Masl&ucirc;m we came to the
end of our worst troubles. The new Commandant
was not so incurably Asiatic. He
realized that prisoners, like other men, love life,
and freedom, and the open sky. That summer
we had a wide and high hill-side made free to us.
We could spend the whole day there if we liked.
The Lower Camp had an even better recreation
ground in a rocky hill just beyond their houses.
We were allowed out in smaller parties and for
longer distances. Smaller parties was a very
great gain, for to walk out in a &#8220;crocodile&#8221; is
so unpleasant that it is almost better to stay
indoors. We used to get a sentry, and go off
into the hills with our lunch, and picnic all day.
And as we could go in several directions there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
was not much crowding. There was fishing in
the stream, and bathing in a big pool, and
sketching along the valley above the pipe-line.
It was by far the best time we ever had in
Turkey, and all because England and her Allies
were winning the war. For it certainly was that
consideration which caused them to send us Zair
Bey.</p>

<p>Among the prisoners there were some who
said, &#8220;When we win the war the Turks will
massacre us all.&#8221; But those among us who knew
the East said, &#8220;When we win the war the Turks
will lick our boots and feed out of our hands.&#8221;
We were right. Had we <i>lost</i> the war it would
have been quite another matter, and this history
would never have been written.</p>

<p>It was different now from the old days when
Toomy and I used to sit by a charcoal brazier
and plan revenge. Our great scheme was to introduce
rabbits into Anatolia: the country was
suitable, and they were to overrun the whole land,
worse than in Australia, and eat up all the young
crops. We also thought of water hyacinth in
the Tigris and Euphrates. But we were winning
the war now, and these guerilla operations would
not be necessary. But we never thought the
end was as near as it proved.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h4>OUR ALLIES</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> in Turkey I only saw Italian prisoners
once. They were locked into railway wagons,
and when they tried to peer out through the
barred windows a German N.C.O. brutally thrust
at their faces with his stick. They were stated to
have elected to come to Turkey rather than to
remain in Austria, where food was short. They
were on their way to work in a mine in the vilayet
of Aidin.</p>

<p>At one time there were a good many Serbs in
Afion, but we saw very little of them. Those I
saw were apparently dying of starvation but they
seemed to be cheerful folk.</p>

<p>There were nine French officers at Afion, and,
except for one who spent a long time in a
Constantinople hospital, they were with us the
whole time. They and the English were on the
best of terms throughout, and they were a very
nice lot of fellows indeed. They were most studious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
people and only one of them wrote a book.
One of them, however, read through Gibbon&#8217;s
&#8220;Decline and Fall&#8221; three times, besides devouring
every other history he could obtain, and we
had many books. We had a large library of
general fiction, recruited from parcels, and we had
a fairly large reference library of solid works,
partly from parcels and partly from the Education
Department at home. And, between them, the
French must have read nearly all of those hundreds
of books, ranging from &#8220;The Way of an
Eagle&#8221; to Mahan&#8217;s &#8220;Sea Power.&#8221;</p>

<p>The French were extraordinarily generous, too,
in giving up their time to teach their language
to Englishmen. Very few, if any, of them had
not several English pupils, and one ran a large
class. With only one exception they could all
speak English fluently long before most of us
learned much French.</p>

<p>Our pronunciation was, of course, a mystery
to them, nor was it to be wondered at. Their
house was too large for them alone, and Britishers
who wished to study French joined their mess.
They had at one time Australians, a Canadian, a
Lancashire man, and a Scot, and each of them
spoke English in a different way. No wonder
the French found it difficult.</p>

<p>For a whole year once the French were not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
allowed out farther than that strip of street, sunless
and frozen in the winter, dusty in the summer,
and crowded all the year round. The pretext was
a reprisal for some imagined wrong done to
Turkish prisoners in France. We suffered from
a continual threat of reprisals like this. Six
Englishmen were once imprisoned for months in
a loathsome hole in Constantinople for some crime
of our Government, probably invented, and one
of the six died as a result. And there were other
minor cases of the same kind. It is useless for a
civilized people to swap reprisals with savages:
the savages will win every time.</p>

<p>The French temperament was totally different
from the English. They used to get extraordinarily
elated at times, and at other times they
became desperately depressed. We did both of
these things too, but our pendulum was longer
and did not swing so suddenly. In the great
German offensive of the spring of 1918 we refused
to be downhearted. &#8220;They will take Paris!&#8221;
the French would cry. &#8220;Very likely,&#8221; we would
reply; &#8220;perhaps we are leading them on.&#8221; There
was unpleasantness over this kind of divergence,
and they would say despairingly, &#8220;Oh! you
bloody English! You do not understand.&#8221; But
no real quarrel ever resulted. The most frequent
offender was an Irish major, who assiduously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
studied French. His joy was to lead his tutor to
the verge of hysterics by calculated callousness
regarding German victories. The poor tutor
would scream at him, but they were really the
best of friends. &#8220;Unless I rouse him,&#8221; the
major would say, &#8220;he won&#8217;t speak fast enough to
give me the practice in conversation that I
require.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shall never forget a scene in the church,
where, by the way, the French beat us at all
points in quiet endurance of a detestable experience.
A certain French officer resented having
his belongings searched, and certain articles of
Turkish clothing &#8220;stolen&#8221; from him. In
revenge he shaved off his moustache, fitted a
large newspaper cocked hat upon his head, and
strutted fiercely up and down the central aisle,
looking the very personification of <i>revanche</i>. He
was a tiny man, very clever, and a great mathematician.
Why he did it the Lord alone knows,
but he did; and he felt as one embarking upon
a forlorn hope. There was not a smile in the
affair&mdash;on his side&mdash;from beginning to end.</p>

<p>The French senior officer was a very fine man,
one of the best-read and all-round best-informed
men I have ever met, and he ran his rather difficult
mixed French and British house tactfully
and well.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Utterly different were the Russians. To begin
with, a great many of them were not prisoners of
war at all, but the officers and engineers of Black
Sea trading vessels. These unfortunates had not
been allowed to leave Constantinople when they
wished to, about a week before war was declared,
and they were older prisoners than any of us.
&#8220;Comme vous &ecirc;tes jeune!&#8221; said one to me when
I told him I had just completed my third year.
He had done nearly four. Then they belonged
to many nationalities, some of them peoples one
had hardly heard of before the war: Ukrainians,
Lithuanians, Poles, Polish Jews, Cossacks,
Georgians, Russian Armenians, Russian Greeks,
Russian Italians, Great Russians and Little Russians,
and others I forget.</p>

<p>Their senior officer was a Commander in the
Black Sea fleet, a very nice, quiet, friendly man
of about fifty. He had lost every single thing
in the world except the few articles of clothing
remaining to him in Turkey, and he knew not
where to turn after the war. All his money had
gone: he received no pay from his Government,
for there was no Government. He had had no
news of his relations since the revolution swallowed
them up, and he said he knew no way of
earning his living except on a ship of war; yet
he was cheerful in a rather plaintive way. Poor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Commander Burikoff! I hope he has found
some haven of refuge.</p>

<p>On the whole, the Russians, as I must continue
to call them, kept very much to themselves,
though there were exceptions to this general rule.
They spoke many tongues, but few of them knew
any English, and not very many of them French.
Uncle Vodka used to talk to us in pigeon-Turkish,
and a few of the British knew a little Russian,
notably two young Australians. Australians beat
all varieties of British in their search for knowledge.
The Russians were bitterly poor. They
had no Embassy money, for they had no protecting
Embassy. How they managed to live at
all was very wonderful. The sailors had started
with full kits, unlike prisoners of war, who
were taken in what they have on; but they
had gradually sold their clothes for food until
they had not much left. The Turks did not
actually let them starve, but they went very near
it, and in the winter they nearly froze. We helped
them sometimes, but they were too proud to be
helped much, and we had not much to give, there
were so many of them. In the summer of 1918
they used to go in gangs to the river, armed with
every conceivable kind of drag-net, and sweep
that river clean. Fish they caught in large
quantities and ate them; it was about the only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
meat they got: and they caught crayfish, which
they sold to the British. They did not emulate
some of the British, who caught frogs and ate
them, so far as I know. Perhaps there was no
sustenance in frogs. I ate one one day, but he
must have been the wrong kind. It was said that
they ate cats and I&#8217;m sure I hope they did. The
French used to eat the tortoises that scour the
plains of Anatolia.</p>

<p>My best friend among the Russians was a
colonel, a Georgian prince. He got me to teach
him English, and he would write down the equivalent
of a word in Russian, French, German,
Polish, or Georgian quite indiscriminately. He
was a fine, brave little fellow; dark, muscular, and
astonishingly fiery. I expect he is with Denikin&#8217;s
army now, fighting Bolsheviki. &#8220;Ces
sales types,&#8221; as he used to call them. Years
ago, during some minor outbreak in Russia, his
squadron had arrested Lenin and brought him in,
and the colonel spent vain hours in wishing he
had slain him then and there. Europe would
probably echo his lament.</p>

<p>If Masl&ucirc;m escapes the gallows, woe betide him
if ever he meets the Russian colonel. He will be
killed inevitably. After the frightful punishment
of Constantine B. the colonel protested vigorously,
and got the poor fellow put into hospital.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Not very long afterwards, a sort of commission
of Turkish officials, accompanied, I believe, by a
member of the Spanish Embassy, visited Afion
to look into the question of the Russian prisoners&#8217;
treatment. Masl&ucirc;m Bey did not wish his conduct
to be exposed, so he visited the colonel and
had the effrontery to offer him a bribe of an oke
(2&frac14; lb.) of sugar to say nothing about it. The
little man was furious, and swore that if ever he
met that man with arms in his hand he would kill
him on sight. I sincerely trust he will be robbed
by the British of any such opportunity. When
the commission came he spoke up at once, but
nothing came of it except that the colonel was
locked up for about a week. He had a little
house to himself up a side street, and I often used
to visit him there and devise ways of persuading
him to accept little presents of tea or other things
from parcels; for he never got parcels, and was
miserably poor. It was really quite a dangerous
thing to do, and I had never to let anyone else
see. He was about as safe to handle as a live
bomb with the pin out. The head of the commission
referred to above accused him of secretly
handing a document to the Spaniard. The
Colonel had not done so, and he said so, expecting
his word to be accepted. But the fool of a Turk,
who had probably never met an honest man in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
life, expressed himself still unsatisfied. Up flared
the colonel. &#8220;Search the man!&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
you find it on him I will commit suicide. If not,
you shall.&#8221; The Turk apologized.</p>

<p>There was a Russo-Armenian, a sneak-thief,
and he robbed an Indian officer of some tobacco.
The Indian suspected him and laid a trap into
which he fell. I saw the Russian colonel tell him
off in the street, while the man trembled and went
pale green, and afterwards the Colonel told me
what he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you a revolver?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;No,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you a good razor?&#8221; &#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then borrow a rope and hang yourself. You
have brought shame on the Russian officers. If
you are alive at the end of the war, I shall send
you a pistol. Use it. If you fail, I shall send a
man to kill you, for you are too base for me to
fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was a dangerous little man, but he had
many friends among the English, and his ambition
was to ride in the Grand National. May he
win through!</p>

<p>He had been in the Imperial Guard, and knew
all the Petrograd Court gossip. One day, during
the English lesson, he saw the announcement
of the death of a certain Grand Duke in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
paper, and told me a tale about him. The Grand
Duke was a parallel, in position only, to the Duke
of Connaught, for he was an uncle of the Tsar,
and he was Governor of Turkestan. At the
Tsar&#8217;s coronation, it was his privilege to hold the
crown during part of the ceremony, and, while
doing so, he became enamoured of a vast ruby
which it contained&mdash;call it the Kohinur to complete
the parallel. The stone glistened, and he
desired it very greatly, so he bit it from its setting
and hid it in his cheek. But he was observed,
and brought to book. He was required to take
up his residence in Siberia; and here the story
ought to end, &#8220;and he lived happily for long
afterwards.&#8221; Perhaps he did, for the colonel
told me that, being already married, in Siberia he
committed bigamy, to annoy his nephew.</p>

<p>Russians are very direct people. When they
desire a thing they straightway pursue it. There
was a very large Russian officer in Afion who went
by the name of Uncle Vodka. He was an old
man, a dug-out, and he fought at the siege of
Plevna in 1877-79. He was about 6 ft. 5 in.
high, and very huge. He had a long, broad
beard, and looked like a picture of the Tsar&#8217;s
coachman. He was a direct person. He conceived
the ambition of colouring his body, as a
man might colour a meerschaum pipe, and he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
chose the hill-side to do it on. There he would
lie in the sun without a single stitch of clothing
on his great body, which must have been nearly
a rood in area, and he would turn himself round
and round so as to make the colour even all over.
We used to climb the hill on purpose to see him,
and he was always pleased to meet us. He was a
venerable figure. You might have taken him
for an archdeacon.</p>

<p>Among all these Russians, differing as they
did in caste and kind, there was one thing they
held in common. Despite the mother revolution
and all its children, they still held their belief in
Russia, great and united. Technically speaking,
many of them were the subjects of countries now
at war with each other and with us. But, although
the conditions they lived in were far worse
than ours in the matter of overcrowding, they
clove together as Russians. I studied this question,
and used to get one to interpret for others,
so that my survey might be based broadly; and in
that one respect I found them all the same. There
are no boundaries, they would say, between
Russia and Ukrainia, or between Russia and the
Cossacks. Poland they excepted, and, to some
extent, Georgia; but they denied that the new
divisions of the rest of Russia could endure. There
was neither racial, physical, nor lingual frontier
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
they maintained. And when I asked whether
they did not find it difficult to avoid thorny
subjects, now that their country was giving birth
to republics almost daily, and was torn in pieces
by internal war, they said No; they had all been
taken prisoner as allies of each other and of us,
and allies they still were. The only exceptions,
among the officers, were a hybrid anarchist who
joined the Turks, and the Russo-Armenian sneak-thief.</p>

<p>Russians all call each other by their Christian
names. I once asked a Russian midshipman
what he called the captain of his ship. &#8220;George,&#8221;
he replied. &#8220;And what on the quarter-deck?&#8221;
I asked. &#8220;George, son of Dmitri,&#8221; he said. I
should like to be present to hear Admiral Beatty
called David by a midshipman on the quarter-deck
of the &#8220;Queen Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<h4>THE BERNE CONVENTION</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> hanging fire for a very long time, the
Berne Convention between Great Britain and the
Sublime Porte was signed, and in the course of
time copies reached Afion-Kara-Hissar.</p>

<p>It seemed to us to be framed so that a coach-and-four
could be driven through every one of
its clauses. But, we were winning the war, and
a great many of its provisions were applied. It
was our Magna Charta.</p>

<p>Under this convention a large number of
prisoners were to be exchanged at once, 300
British and 700 Indians against 1,500 Turks, as
far as I can remember.</p>

<p>Of course we all wanted to be included. We
had not known how mad we were to be included
until that ray of hope appeared. It seemed as
though we suddenly saw ourselves as we were,
as new prisoners saw us when they arrived, men
grown listless and almost hopeless, with brave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
words on their lips and chill in their hearts. Of
the 300 British we could not all hope to be, but
for the others there was a further hope, for,
according to the Convention, periodical medical
boards were to be held, and all those suffering
from any of a given list of disabilities were to be
exchanged too.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of heart-burning, and
the camp was the prey of winged rumours, most
of them discouraging ones. I can scarcely bear
to think of that time even now.</p>

<p>The Kut prisoners thought that their five
months&#8217; siege ought to be included in the
period of their captivity. It was only natural
that they should. But even so, we old-timers
had been far longer confined than they had.
Then there was the question of age, and the
older of us did boast of our years, and wish inwardly
that we had added to their number when
first registered by the Turks. Were married
men to have, other things being equal, any consideration?
That was another question, and
men added to the number of their children, if
not of their wives.</p>

<p>These are but a few of the questions that
troubled us.</p>

<p>But, in the end, the Turks ignored much of
the Convention, and began to hold medical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
boards to sort out those who were incapacitated
for further fighting.</p>

<p>On the 8th of August, 1918, the first board
sat in Afion. There were two Turkish doctors
on it, and one British, Capt. Startin, R.A.M.C.
But as one of the Turks made his own decisions,
and the other merely said &#8220;peki,&#8221; which means
&#8220;I concur,&#8221; and as the decision went by a
majority of votes, the British member did not
have much chance. Still, he did succeed in
steering most of the really deserving cases
through, and he did his very best for all of us,
seizing every slightest opportunity and displaying
both diplomatic skill and doggedness to a
high degree.</p>

<p>Of course everyone wanted to be tested.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t win a lottery unless you take a
ticket,&#8221; as someone put it. And when the day
came, and the board assembled in a room at the
Medrisseh, there was far more of us than could
be got through in a day. We sat in the shade
of the poplar trees, in front of the mosque,
and when each officer who had been examined
came out he was bombarded with questions, and
surrounded by an anxious crowd. But no decisions
were announced, and the British representative
was sworn to secrecy, which oath he
kept. How he managed to I am sure I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
know, for the excitement was intense. British
excitement, hardly admitted at all, but gnawing
at the vitals, like the Spartan boy&#8217;s fox.
So no one knew whether he had been passed or
not, though all were agreed that the senior
Turkish doctor was an unpleasant creature,
jocular and offensive, and very hard to satisfy.
The fact was that he knew little or nothing of
his job, found difficulty in understanding the
terms of reference, hated the British, and distrusted
everyone in the world.</p>

<p>That day passed in hidden agony.</p>

<p>The next day, the third anniversary of my
capture, my turn came. I did not think there
was much chance, but had faint hopes that some
hidden doom might reveal itself to the trained
skill of a doctor. Really the only things wrong
with me were that I had lost three and a half
stone in weight and had lumbago. So when
asked to strip and to state what my claim was
based on I said lumbago. The senior Turkish
doctor never glanced at my lumbago region at
all. But he laid me down and performed some
of the mysteries of his craft. And all the time
he kept on talking to me. We had quite an
argument in French. He asked me why I knew
no Turkish, and I replied that it was too dangerous,
that Masl&ucirc;m Bey had sent officers to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
gaol for knowing Turkish; and this was perfectly
true, though it was not my reason. I did not
want to lumber my brain with Turkish. Also,
as a writer of codes, and in order to avoid suspicion
generally, it had never been my object
to display much intelligence to Turks. It was
too dangerous, as I said. Not that I pretended
to be mad, as did two officers of another camp
who were successful in bamboozling the best
Turkish doctors, on the contrary I pretended to
be sane. I did not &#8220;wangle,&#8221; to use the term
in vogue, one particle. The doctor further cross-examined
me. Whey did I wish to leave
Turkey? he asked. I said I wanted to see my
wife and daughter. We came to a little bickering,
and, in spite of my deficient French, repartee
came to me quicker than to him, and
I won.</p>

<p>The verdict did not come until some days
later. Several of the most necessitous cases had
been rejected; for instance, an officer with a
double hernia and an officer suffering from
genuine fits. One man who had lost an eye
was included, another rejected. And several
perfectly able-bodied officers and men had been
included.</p>

<p>I was included myself. But not for lumbago.
I was passed unfit on the score of being mad.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
The senior Turkish doctor failed to understand
my simple nature, and turning to his colleague,
he said, &#8220;I think he is mad.&#8221; The colleague
duly responded &#8220;Peki&#8221;; the British
officer, who understood Turkish and acted as
interpreter told Startin, and that best of men
said I had been very queer for some time back.
He was perfectly right. We were all as queer
as queer could be. The good fellow took the
first chance of reassuring me, but it was no good.
I used to get people on whom I could rely,
privately in corners (bystanders were buttonholed
and prayed with, as the <i>War Cry</i> used to print),
and ask them as man to man whether I was
really mad. They all said no. But it was no
good. I thought that, even if not mad, I must
at least have very shaken nerves, and continued
to think so until, months after, at Alexandria,
a kind-hearted pilot took me up in an aeroplane,
and stunted me scientifically, loops and double
loops, spinning nose dives, and side slips, and
other glories of the air. Never having been
within half a mile of an aeroplane before, this
convinced me that my nerves were still fairly
sound; for I came down half drunken with the
splendour of it all, ate a hearty meal, and went
through it all again the same afternoon. It was
like drinking champagne on top of a mountain;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
and for the first time since being a prisoner I
was glad not to have lived a century earlier.</p>

<p>But once I was a certified lunatic, and have
never been uncertified since.</p>

<p>After the medical board came a few dreadful
weeks. Every day brought forth a new rumour.
We heard that the Germans had refused safe-conduct
to the repatriation ship, and it was true.
We heard that the medical board at Broussa,
which had passed some of the generals there,
had been squashed, and that a new board had
rejected them; and it was true. We heard that
the sickest men of all, who had been sent to
Constantinople for exchange some time back&mdash;an
old R.C. padre with a bad heart, a youngster
with nearly every disability a man may have
and live, and others&mdash;had been rejected. And
that was true, too, for they came back to us
again.</p>

<p>It was a perfectly awful time, and won&#8217;t bear
writing about.</p>

<p>At last, on the 9th of September, we received
orders to leave for Smyrna by the evening
train.</p>

<p>There had been a perfect epidemic of escape
projects recently. It was partly caused by sheer
weariness of spirit, partly by a leading mind
recently installed among us, partly by encouragement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
through secret messages from England,
and partly by a hope of joining the exchange
train and mixing unnoticed with the lucky ones.
There were several sorts of would-be escapers.
The best sort thought things out thoroughly,
kept their mouths shut, and went. The worst
sort talked about it frequently, for years, and
did not go. The first were greatly to be admired;
but the second were a pest to the whole
camp in a land where the whole community
suffered for the escapade of one. All the escapers
who actually started were brave men, and
I wish more of them had got through.</p>

<p>The day we started for Smyrna, for we did
start, a party of three escaped; and the escape
was not discovered by the Turks until we were
in the train. There were thirteen officers, and
I forget how many men, and we were counted
and recounted several times. Then all the luggage
vans were searched through and all the
large boxes opened, and the train was searched
from end to end. But the three were not found,
they were far away in the hills. So we left
Afion under suspicion, and with armed guards
in every carriage to prevent anyone from boarding
the train.</p>

<p>Our last view of the camp was most affecting.
There was a spontaneous outburst of noble good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
feeling and unselfish gladness, unmixed with
any envy of our good luck. None of us thought
the end of the war was near, yet those who
stayed behind cheered those who went, with
never a sign of an afterthought. It was not just
a few, it was everyone; and we literally had to
struggle through the crowd in the street with
our arms aching from hearty handshakes. It is
a very splendid last memory of Afion.</p>

<p>I had been there two years and seven months.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<h4>SMYRNA</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> first night in the train was rather uncomfortably
crowded, but we would not have minded
being piled in heaps on that journey. In the
morning we reached a place called Ushak, and
there had rather a shock, for all thirteen officers
were ushered into a dirty shed and informed that
it was a hospital, and that we were all to be examined
for cholera. This was more serious than
appears on the face of it, for two of our party
were rather out of sorts, and a Turkish doctor
would be quite liable to mistake this malady for
cholera. Then good-bye to hope for them. They
would have been put in some disgusting place
with all manner of afflicted people, and it is by no
means improbable that they would have died.
The Turkish doctor had an assistant with a microscope,
but we didn&#8217;t trust either of them one bit:
so we refused to be examined. I can&#8217;t enter into
details, but we refused unanimously to do what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
they required. There was an impasse. We
could not proceed without health certificates, for
there were quarantine regulations in force. Of
course, we could, in the last resource, bribe the
doctor, but we preferred not to. We stood fast
upon the dignity of British officers, and said they
did not do that kind of thing. It was much
cheaper to bluff than to bribe, and we wanted all
our money. I suggested to the Turkish officer
in charge that he should hire a peasant to be
examined on our behalf, and offered to pay the
man ten piastres for his courtesy. But that
obviously sound suggestion was ruled out as being
unscientific. The honour of the medical profession
and the prestige of the microscope had to be
upheld. It ended in a compromise. The doctor
agreed to accept three delegates as representatives
of the whole party. Three strong men volunteered
to be examined, and we threatened them
with all manner of revenge if they proved to have
any obscure disease that would hold us up. But
they passed the ordeal safely and we were
solemnly granted thirteen clean bills of health
and allowed to proceed.</p>

<p>The men were detained for examination,
despite all we could do, but they reached Smyrna
a day later without mishap. As it turned out,
they were lucky to be late.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
The approach to Smyrna from inland is a very
beautiful journey. The railway runs through the
fruitful valley of Magnina, flanked by great hills,
and full of vineyards and groves of figs and
olives.</p>

<p>We were travelling in comfort now. Our
second night had been passed in a truck, rather
hilariously, I am afraid, for three of us celebrated
an Old Wykehamist dinner and sang &#8220;Domum&#8221;
most of the night through. For the last few
hours of the journey we had the company of a
Roman Catholic priest, a quiet, gentle, young
man from Austria, very sad about the condition
of his country and very much concerned at all the
excesses of the Turks. He found his hard life a
very hopeless struggle against corruption and
cruelty of every kind. I had not up to then met
so thoroughly pro-British an enemy.</p>

<p>We reached the Point station at Smyrna early
in the afternoon. Where we were to be lodged we
did not know. The Turkish officer in charge of
us had treated us well; he was the only member
of the staff of Masl&ucirc;m Bey who had come through
the inquiry without a single charge against him.
But he had no influence, and he was very junior;
moreover, he laboured under unjust suspicion of
having assisted the three officers who escaped the
day we left Afion. We heard their fate later on,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
and it may as well be recorded here. They had
only got two or three days&#8217; journey into the hills
when they were captured by brigands, who debated
for some time what to do with them. At
last one of them thought he saw a chance of
escape, and made a dash; but he was shot, and the
others two were released and driven away. They
were not allowed to assist their companion, and
he was last seen wounded and in the hands of the
brigands. His two companions gave themselves
up to the nearest Turkish authorities and succeeded
in getting a search party sent out. They
tried hard to be allowed, on temporary parole, to
accompany the party, but were refused permission
and their friend has not been heard of since.
Earlier in the war, after the fall of Antwerp, he
had been interned in Holland, but had escaped,
and eventually joined the R.N.A.S. It was
indeed hard luck that he should die in an unsuccessful
second escape only seven weeks before
Turkey went out of the war.</p>

<p>Guided by the Turkish officer, we walked
through the streets of Smyrna to the military
headquarters, a large building that faced a public
garden, where the band played in the afternoons
and children disported themselves with their
nurses.</p>

<p>Our reception was very chilly. Our friendly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
officer was a very small person here, and could do
nothing for us; and we could not find anyone
who knew anything about us. They had never
heard of any Berne Convention or of any arrangement
for exchange of prisoners, and they suspected
us all of having escaped and been sent there
for punishment. For a long time we waited in a
passage, wondering what would be the upshot of
it all, and then the usual thing happened, for we
were cast into gaol. After all our visions of a
week or two of absolute liberty while waiting
for the ship, this was a terrible anti-climax. We
were thrust into the military lock-up, and two
sentries with fixed bayonets were placed at the
door.</p>

<p>It was a dark and very dirty room, with a
broken wooden floor that long experience warned
us against lying on, and there were no chairs or
furniture of any kind. Five Indian officers were
thrown into it with us, and were as indignant as
we. There was no one to appeal to. Our senior
officer, the only one who spoke Turkish, had remained
at the station to watch our baggage, and
the officer who had escorted us had gone back to
him. After a while an interpreter came to us,
and we urged him to fetch a senior officer who
could hear our complaint. A long time after this
a very hard-faced and thoroughly Prussianised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Turkish colonel came in with the interpreter, and
we explained that we were sick men sent down for
exchange. He listened coldly, and said he knew
nothing about that, and that we were very well
where we were. Afterwards the interpreter told
us he was in a bad temper because seven hundred
of his regiment had deserted to the hills, and he
had only discovered it that morning.</p>

<p>We looked out through the bars rather dolefully,
and watched the rank and fashion of
Smyrna in the garden. There seemed little hope
of getting out, or of getting any food in, and our
bedding was at the station.</p>

<p>Again a typically Turkish thing occurred.
There was a privy just outside the door, the other
side of the sentries. One officer was compelled
to ask permission to go to it. The request was
passed out by the sentries, and the officer was led
out into the garden, before all the women and
children. This was the more unnecessary because
the proper place was there, just across the passage.
It may be that Turks do not consider this sort of
exhibition objectionable, but to an Englishman
or to an Indian officer it is more humiliating than
any private cruelty. It was a studied policy of
the Turks to play upon our sensitiveness to indecency.
The unspeakable Turk: with all our
languages and vocabularies we never found a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
phrase to rival that: unspeakable he was and unspeakable
he is.</p>

<p>Suddenly the &#8220;strafe&#8221; ended. The British
chaplain had got to know of our plight, and had
gained the ear of someone in authority. After
having paced the streets of Smyrna as comparatively
free men on the way from the station, we
were taken in close marching order between
guards with fixed bayonets to a very dirty Turkish
officers&#8217; hotel and given rooms. A sentry with
a fixed bayonet sat on a chair at the end of the
passage. We of the Old Wykehamist dinner
shared a room, and I slept like a top: the others
tossed and moaned, and in the morning slew a
vast number of intruders, many hundreds. But
this hotel was our very last experience of these
pests, for life, I hope.</p>

<p>The next day the Vali came to see us, Rahmy
Bey, the governor of the province of Aidin. After
his visit all the frowns turned to smiles, for he
was known to favour good treatment of the subjects
of the Entente.</p>

<p>A day or two later we moved once more, this
time in the greatest comfort. Can you but gain
one gesture of protection from a great man in an
Eastern country, you may go in peace, for the
underlings are but looking-glasses to reflect his
mood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
We drove in carriages to the station, and travelled
first class a few miles by rail to the suburb
called Paradise. That is its name since Roman
times, and it was Paradise indeed to us.</p>

<p>We were established in the fine buildings of the
International College, an American foundation
with a Canadian in charge of it as principal. Dr.
Maclachlan was his name, and he and Mr. Reed,
an American gentleman who is second in command,
gave us the warmest, kindest welcome in
the world. They and the ladies of the staff had a
sumptuous tea awaiting us, and everything that
man or woman could do they did. We had not
known the like for many years.</p>

<p>There is a little colony of British and Americans
at Paradise, and everyone of them deserves to
be there. The whole great building was at our
disposal: dormitories for the men, small rooms
for the officers, a school conduit to wash in,
shower baths, electric light, a fine library, and
perfect cleanliness. It was the cleanliness of the
building and the kindness of their hearts that appealed
to us. I confess without any shame that
it almost broke me down. And there were children
to play with, bright, merry, little American
and English children. As our men came in, some
on crutches, some limping, all of them thin and
weary, I saw one of those kind hosts of ours pick
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
up a crippled Indian sepoy on his back and carry
him up the stairs. They nursed our sick, they
mended and washed our clothes, they cooked
dainty little dishes for the convalescents, and they
gave us all heart once more. We were unclean
and uncivilized, queerer perhaps than we knew,
and they brought back to us the knowledge that
the world as a whole is good.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that all our troubles
were over. We were still in Turkey. The officer
who had charge of us was a Cretan Turk, a kind-hearted
but rather diffident man. He received his
orders from one army corps, and the officer in
charge of the guard from another. The result
was chaos: for while the Cretan gave us very considerable
privileges, his plans were defeated by
the officer of the guard, a conceited little puppy of
about nineteen, who did nothing but swagger
about with a sword. He was wholly malicious and
possibly a little bit wrong in the head. He tormented
the good lady who nursed our worst cases
by telling her the bloody deeds he itched to do;
the finest sensation on earth, he said, was to feel
your steel pass through an enemy&#8217;s body. But
she turned upon him and told him that in a few
months he would be selling melons on the street
for a living. When the Cretan, who was a senior
captain, gave us leave to go out into the ample
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
grounds of the college, this little squirt ordered
the guard to prevent us; and in like way he
made himself so intolerable that Dr. Maclachlan
spoke to a higher power and got him removed.
After that things went quite smoothly.</p>

<p>There was a very large playing field attached
to the college, twenty acres, I think it was; there
was a chapel with an organ in it, an auditorium
with a grand piano, and a large, well-equipped
gymnasium. We began by using a few rooms of
the main building, and ended by filling the whole
establishment, even the chapel. For parties
were coming in almost daily from all over Turkey.
At first they were nearly all sick men, some of
them at the very point of death. We lost sixteen
men in Smyrna, who died before they could be
exchanged, almost within sight of home. But
later on, when the Turks found they could not
make up the thousand in any other way, all the camps
were combed through again, and a great
many of the later arrivals had nothing whatever
the matter with them except the awful disease of
prison weariness: a disease that, fortunately, few
people know, but which none who have known it
will ever forget.</p>

<p>It was astonishing at first to realize how few
really sick men there were, but the explanation
was not far to seek: the sick had died. Some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
of those who passed medical boards were almost
ludicrous. One, I remember, had an abnormally
rough and thick skin, had had it all his
life. Another had complained that he felt tired.
Another had been late for the medical board, in
fact, he had only gone up for a joke, and at the
last moment; but he pleaded that he had rested
so many times by the way that he could not get
there in time. He was one of the best football
players in Turkey, but he was passed.</p>

<p>Another large contingent came from Afion,
others from Broussa, Constantinople, Gedos&mdash;the
parole camp, where officers who chose to give
their parole could go and enjoy almost complete
liberty; from Angora, and from all the camps in
the Taurus mountains. These last were the
weakest of the whole. They were the survivors
of a terrible slavery.</p>

<p>The European community of Smyrna, save for
about a week near the beginning of the war, had
been allowed to live in their own houses and to go
where they pleased in Smyrna and its widespread
suburbs. They will perhaps disagree with me
when I say that they had been very well treated.
This was due to the political sagacity of the Vali,
Rahmy Bey, who seems to have realized from the
beginning that Turkey was on the wrong side.
He has been accused of vast speculations, and he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
certainly tolerated massacre and wholesale deportation
of the Greeks; but he protected the
Armenians in his province, and spread his cloak
over the subjects of the Entente. For that we
must be very grateful. I met him several times
and found him clever, strong, and amusing. He
is a very notable Turk, and may rule Turkey some
day.</p>

<p>Many of the French and British subjects came
to visit us, and, later, when we were free, we
enjoyed much hospitality at their hands. One
of them told me that the dearth of news was so
great during the beginning of the German retreat
that smuggled copies of the <i>Times</i> newspaper had
commanded the enormous price of one pound per
hour of perusal.</p>

<p>We waited on and on. The college was filled
to overflowing, and another camp was started
in another part of Smyrna. Nobody knew
when the ship would come, or even where it
would come to. But the resistance of the enemy
was crumbling. Turkish officers told us that
their armies were mere skeleton forces. They
estimated that there were six hundred thousand
deserters in the hills. A story was told of a
battalion ordered from Smyrna to the Palestine
front, which melted on the railway journey until
there was only one man left besides the C.O.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
Bulgaria gave way. The Palestine front gave
way, and a Turkish staff officer told me that their
estimate of losses there alone was ninety-two
thousand men. It was plain that the war was
coming to an end.</p>

<p>Exactly two weeks before Turkey actually
signed the Armistice we were set free, absolutely
free. Some officers were received into the
houses of residents in Bournabat, the chief
suburb of Smyrna; some went into hotels where
meals cost whole fortunes; some stayed on in
the College; and, with three others, I rented a
small furnished house just outside the College
gates. It belonged to a Mrs. Constantine, the
wife of a Greek gentleman, a master at the College.
He was a man who had travelled, and
lived in America, and he was heartily on our
side. But the conscription had netted him in
as a transport driver, and he was believed to be
now a prisoner in British hands. We tried to
console poor Mrs. Constantine by telling her
that he would be quite safe there, much safer
than with the Turks; but she wanted him back,
poor soul, and so did little Chloe and Aeneas, his
children.</p>

<p>During this fortnight we did as we pleased, and
enjoyed life.</p>

<p>More than one family among the European
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
residents were exceedingly kind to us, and made
us free of their homes.</p>

<p>It was also my good fortune, through Mrs.
Reed, to make the acquaintance of some Greek
ladies, and more whole-hearted fiery patriots I
have never listened to. The Peace Conference
is now, as I write, ponderously considering the
future of Turkey, and their fate still hangs in
the balance. The Smyrna Greeks long for
union with Greece, long for it as a sailor longs
for the sea, although they know that it may
bring them poverty; for the district of Smyrna
is rich in comparison with Greek proper, and
would perhaps be bled to feed Athens. They
know that, but they burn to throw off the
tyranny of the Turks. Who can but sympathize
with them?</p>

<p>The European permanent residents, on the
other hand, wish for the Turks to remain, for
by accommodating the chief Turkish officials
they can make much money. But they are in
a vast minority to the Greeks; they are aliens,
and the Greeks were there two thousand years
before the Turks were. They should have no
say in the matter, beyond what is just. Their
say in this matter should be governed by the
extent to which they aided the war, on the Entente
side. This I may say without a breach of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
hospitality, for of the only two houses I went
into, one real English and the other French,
there was not one member who was eligible for
fighting; and the people of Paradise did contribute
their sons to the war, but they are not
permanent residents. Under the capitulations a
very strange community grew up in Turkey.
All sorts of people assumed British, French, or
Italian nationality for the sake of the protection
it gave them. They speak all tongues, more or
less, and the &#8220;British&#8221; among them are often
less like Englishmen than are the Eurasians of
India. There are many families of &#8220;British&#8221;
who can speak no English at all; nearly
all the rest, except the rare ones who
have been educated &#8220;at home,&#8221; speak what,
further East, we call Chichi English. They
are &#8220;British&#8221; in inverted commas, and they
&#8220;supported&#8221; our cause mostly in inverted
commas too.</p>

<p>Whether the Turks&#8217; own claim to Smyrna is
a just one I am not competent to judge. The
mere fact that they have hideously misgoverned
should not invalidate their claim provided that
they are in a genuine majority, not a majority
obtained by deportation and massacre. For
their system of Government can be improved
and kept watch over.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
What is to be the future of the Turks, in
any case?</p>

<p>That they should hold no subject countries is
obvious. But in their own country, where they
do actually form the majority of the population,
what is their future? Their official classes are
abominable people. They can oppress, but they
have no aptitude for the wider forms of business
and banking, building and organizing, or any
form of creative work. A Turkish financier is
more Hooligan than Hooley. They cannot
compete with the Christians in bloodless ventures.
We used to dream of various fates for
them, but the fate that is coming is worse than
we dreamed. They are bankrupt; there will
soon be neither pay nor pension for most of them.
While they still ruled Armenia, Mesopotamia,
Syria, Palestine, and the coasts of Arabia, their
system was simple. The &#8220;educated&#8221; Turk got
a post in some branch of the Government service,
with small pay, but a large income. The
pay came from the Government, and the income
from the subject peoples. But that time is
gone, and, as the Turkish officer was told, they
will soon be selling melons on the streets.
Metaphorically that is what they will be doing.
They will be driven to trade; and wherever a
Turk sits down to trade an Armenian will sit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
and he will beggar that Turk. They are waiting
to do it, and looking forward to it.</p>

<p>The Turks tried to govern by an absolute
king, and it failed. They tried to govern by a
<i>soi disant</i> representative assembly, and that
failed; it degenerated into a tyranny by a small
clique, and that tyranny failed too. An oligarchy
is out of the question, for there are no
families in Turkey from which it could be recruited.
There remain soviets, but the Turkish
peasant is not nearly advanced enough for that.
It is even doubtful if any race on earth is. The
Turkish peasant is to the full as backward as,
or more backward than, the Indian peasant, and
he has much fewer brains. It seems to be more
a question of evolution than of revolution for the
Turks. From our little way up the cliff of
civilisation we look down to the Turk, and he
seems too far away for us to lend him a helping
hand.</p>

<p>The Turkish people do not include a middle
class or an aristocracy. The reasons will be
found in any good history of their slave theory
of government, but the reasons concern Europe
less than does the fact. With a small margin
of error, all Turks may be described as falling
in one of two categories, namely, officials and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
peasants. My opinion of the officials must be
plain to anyone who has read thus far, and needs
no reinforcing. But the peasants have a great
many very good qualities. They are brave,
cheerful, and very patient people, hospitable and
generous by nature, and the simplest of the
simple. They lie and steal much less than do
the Christians in their land, and infinitely less
than their own officials. On the other hand,
they are stupid, and they have been for centuries
so inured to brutality that they value human life
and human pain not at all. If you strayed into
a Turkish village you would probably be treated
as a guest, and given of their best. But you
might see these same villagers sally forth to
burn, rape, and kill in a neighbouring village of
Christians.</p>

<p>The only future for Turkey seems to be for
the whole race to go back to the land until from
the soil there rises a middle class able in the
course of time to produce rulers of men. In
the meantime, some European Power or
America should have a mandate, not only the
League of Nations&#8217; mandate, but the Turks&#8217; own
mandate, to do for them the things they cannot
do; to provide judges and governors, railway
and postal controllers, and to officer a police
force. Personally, I believe they would, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
British or Americans, be the easiest people on
earth to rule.</p>

<p>I must write one word on our other enemies,
the Germans in Turkey. There was a German
in the Taurus who boasted that, by his treatment
of British prisoners, he had killed more
enemies than anyone on the Western front. But
he was almost alone in that respect. With
few exceptions, Germans in Turkey treated
Britishers in misfortune as brother white men
in an Eastern land. Especially was this so in
the air service, where chivalry ran higher than
in any other branch of the fighting. German
airmen who had brought a Britisher down always
treated him well; very often they went over
our lines and, at the risk of their machines or
their lives, dropped a note from the captured
one asking that his kit might be sent along.
Then one of our machines would fly back, unmolested,
and drop the kit. There were several
officers in Afion who had received their kit in
this way. There was also an officer who had
been defeated in a fight in the air, and to whom
his victor gave his own silver watch with an inscription
engraved upon it commemorating the
combat. The German passed through Afion
long afterwards, and came to see if he could do
anything more to help his late enemy. Another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
officer in Afion was taken prisoner in Palestine,
in thin clothes, and had to proceed up to Afion,
where it was cold. In the train he met a
German officer who was going on leave home,
and this man divided up his shirts, his socks,
and his underclothes, and fitted the Englishman
out. Since coming to England I have seen in
the papers that a clergyman was fined &pound;10 for
giving a German prisoner some tobacco, and a
farmer 40<i>s</i>. for giving a German prisoner half
a loaf and a bottle of ginger-beer. Is there not
a better way of looking at things than this? I
am not pro-German, very far from it, but I am
pro anything generous or kind, and I know what
it is to be a prisoner.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<h4>THE SHIP</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last the ship came, and lay off Phokea, outside
the Gulf of Smyrna.</p>

<p>We went off in tugs, out of that lovely bay,
more beautiful, to my mind, than the bay of
Naples, and we went on board the Australian
hospital ship &#8220;Kanowna,&#8221; where they gave us
a royal welcome.</p>

<p>This was the 1st of November, 1918.</p>

<p><i>August the 9th</i>, 1915&mdash;<i>November the 1st</i>,
1918.</p>

<p>They had many cots prepared, expecting
many sick and cripples. They asked as we came
on board where the sick were, and we replied
that they were dead.</p>

<p>Phokea was a beautiful little Greek town when
war broke out; it has vineyards and olive groves
behind it, and it looks out on the bluest of bays.
It had once been inhabited by Greek subjects
of the Turks, but now it lay bare and empty,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
with hollow windows staring at the sea. There
was an old Englishman on board, a civilian who
had been many years in Smyrna, and him I
asked why it lay thus desolate. &#8220;When the
Turks declared a Jihad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a holy war,
soldiers and a rabble came to Phokea, and
crucified the Greek men upon olive trees; the
women they raped and then cut their hands and
feet off. What happened to the children I do
not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>There our last sun set on Turkey, and we
steamed away to the South.</p>

&#8220;To do our difficulties justice I think you ought to say that
besides the loss of value of paper against gold, the rise of
prices reduced the purchasing power of the &pound;Tq to <i>one-twentieth</i>
of what it was in the summer of 1915. This is strictly
true. I have a list of the prices of ordinary commodities up to
Spring, 1918. Actually the purchasing value of &pound;20 from
England was between twenty and twenty-four shillings in the
winter 1917-18 as compared to the early Autumn, 1915.&#8221;&mdash;A.D.P.</p></div>

<h3>POEMS IN CAPTIVITY</h3>

<h5>Crown 8vo. <b>7s. 6d.</b> net.</h5>

<p>John Still was captured by the Turks in Gallipoli
in 1915, and remained in captivity for over
three years, during which he found it essential
to have some absorbing mental occupation to
preserve his sanity. He discovered in himself
then, for the first time, the power of writing
verse. For many years before the war he lived in
Ceylon, and the latter part of the book is taken
up with poems on its peoples and lost cities, the first
part containing the poems inspired by captivity.</p>

<p class="add"><i>Morning Post.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The poems have a quiet power that grows
on the reader.&#8221;<br /><br />

<h3>THE ROAD TO EN-DOR</h3>

<h5><i>Being an Account of how two prisoners of War<br />
at Yozgad in Turkey won their way to freedom.</i></h5>

<h4>By E. H. JONES, Lieut. Indian Army Reserve</h4>

<h5>With Illustrations by C. W. HILL, Lieut. R.A.F.</h5>

<h5>Third Edition.   Crown 8vo.   <b>8s. 6d.</b> net.</h5>

<p>This book, besides being an extraordinary story,
will specially appeal to every one who is interested
in spiritualism. It tells in minute and exact detail how
two young British officers, who previously knew nothing
of the subject, took up spiritualism&mdash;originally to
amuse their fellow-prisoners in a Turkish prison camp;
how they afterwards convinced not only the Turkish
officials of their mediumistic powers, but even their
fellow-officers; how eventually the &#8220;spook&#8221; ran the
camp, securing many privileges for the inmates, and
finally nearly effected the escape of the mediums and
kidnapped the Turkish Governor and Interpreter.
Afterwards the two officers feigned madness so effectually
that they were repatriated on compassionate grounds
as insane, and had some difficulty in convincing the
British authorities of their sanity. The book reads like
a wild romance, but it is authenticated in every detail by
fellow-officers and official documents. The Turkish
Governor was actually court-martialled for his part in
a treasure hunt instituted by the &#8220;spook&#8221;; and since
the Armistice the authors have received letters from
Turkish officials asking them to return and persist in the
search for the hidden treasure.</p>

<p class="add"><i>Morning Post.</i>&mdash;&#8220;It is easily the most surprising story of the
escape of prisoners of war which has yet appeared.... No more
effective exposure of the methods of the medium has ever been
written.... This book is indeed an invaluable reduction to
absurdity of the claims of the spiritualist coteries.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Daily Telegraph.</i>&mdash;&#8220;This is one of the most realistic, grimmest,
and at the same time most entertaining, books ever given to the
public.... &#8216;The Road to En-dor&#8217; is a book with a thrill on every
page, is full of genuine adventure.... Everybody should read it.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Times.</i>&mdash;&#8220;Astounding.... Of great value.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Punch.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The most extraordinary war-tale which has come
my way.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Birmingham Post.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The story of surely the most colossal
&#8216;fake&#8217; of modern times.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Daily Graphic.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The most amazing story of the war.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Outlook.</i>&mdash;&#8220;It deserves to become a classic.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Evening News.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The tale of the two lieutenants is perhaps
the noblest example of the game and fine art of spoof that the world
has ever seen, or ever will see ... their wonderful and almost
monstrous elaboration ... an amazing story.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Bystander.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The book reads like the wildest romance.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Glasgow Evening News.</i>&mdash;&#8220;An absolutely fresh, unexpected,
and inimitable true story of what we fancy is the greatest spoof of
the Great War.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Everyman.</i>&mdash;&#8220;One of the most amazing tales that we have
ever read. The gradual augmentation of the spook&#8217;s power is one
of the most preposterous, the most laughable histories in the whole
literature of spoofing. Lieut. Jones has given us a wonderful book&mdash;even
a great book.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>New Statesman.</i>&mdash;&#8220;This amazing story is told in great detail,
but never tedious.&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE SILENCE OF<br />
COLONEL BRAMBLE</h3>

<h4>By ANDR&Eacute; MAUROIS</h4>

<h5>Second Edition. <b>5s.</b> net.</h5>

<p class="add"><i>Westminster Gazette.</i>&mdash;&#8220;&#8216;The Silence of Colonel Bramble&#8217; is
the best composite character sketch I have seen to show France
what the English gentleman at war is like ... much delightful
humour.... It is full of good stories.... The translator
appears to have done his work wonderfully well.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Daily Telegraph.</i>&mdash;&#8220;This book has enjoyed a great success in
France, and it will be an extraordinary thing if it is not equally successful
here.... Those who do not already know the book in
French will lose nothing of its charm in English form. The
humours of the mess-room are inimitable.... The whole thing is
real, alive, sympathetic; there is not a false touch in all its delicate,
glancing wit.... One need not be a Frenchman to appreciate its
wisdom and its penetrating truth.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Star.</i>&mdash;&#8220;An excellent translation ... a gay and daring
translation ... I laughed over its audacious humour.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Times.</i>&mdash;&#8220;This admirable French picture of English officers.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Daily Graphic.</i>&mdash;&#8220;A triumph of sympathetic observation ...
delightful book ... many moving passages.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Daily Mail.</i>&mdash;&#8220;So good as to be no less amusing than the
original.... This is one of the finest feats of modern translation
that I know. The book gives one a better idea of the war than any
other book I can recall.... Among many comical disputes the
funniest is that about superstitions. That really is, in mess language,
&#8216;A scream.&#8217;&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>New Statesman.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The whole is of a piece charmingly
harmonious in tone and closely woven together.... The book
has a perfect ending.... Few living writers achieve so great
a range of sentiment, with so uniformly light and unassuming a
manner.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Observer.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The flavour of M. Maurois&#8217; humour loses little
in this translation.... The admirable verisimilitude of the
dialogue.... M. Maurois&#8217; humorous gift is unusually varied....
He tells a good story with great vivacity.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Holbrook Jackson in the <i>National News</i>.&mdash;&#8220;The Colonel is an
eternal delight.... I put the volume under my arm, started
reading it on the way home, and continued reading until I had
finished the same evening.... That ought to be sufficient recommendation
for any book....&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Times Lit. Supplement.</i>&mdash;(Review of French Edition.)&mdash;&#8220;M.
Maurois ... is indeed so good an artist and so excellent an
observer that we would not for worlds spoil his hand, or do more
than merely introduce to English readers by far the most interesting
and amusing group of British officers that we have met in books
since the war began.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Gentlewoman.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The translation of this book is so splendidly
done that it seems impossible that it can be a translation.... One
of the very few war books which survive Peace.... This is one of
the few war books that will not collect dust on the bookshelf.&#8221;<br />
<br />
James Milne in the <i>Graphic</i>.&mdash;&#8220;It is all very wise and very
charming.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Morning Post.</i>&mdash;&#8220;This gently-humorous little book.... Half-an-hour
with Colonel Bramble and his entertaining friends will stop
you worrying for a whole day.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<i>Saturday Review.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The wittiest book of comment on warfare
and our national prejudices that we have yet seen.&#8221;</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
